Glad to hear that!
I love comedy, horror, and drama. Occasionally an action / adventure / thriller
Things like [ITEM] are always funny to me
As far as horror, I like movies like [ITEM]

Haven't seen Thor yet
Oh yeah! A FAVORITE! Seen it live twice, and several filmed variations
Yes, I actually saw it when it premiered!
I prefer the original, yet they both are good.
Something about the new one just wasn't quite the same, I suppose to each their own...but I vote for the original for sure

I'll have to watch or re-watch that one
You did for sure, I'm looking forward to checking out your recomendations!

I watched the movie [ITEM] in theaters last night for the second time and I laughed even harder this time, I love that movie, it's so funny.
Do you know of any other movies like that?

I've never seen [ITEM] or [ITEM] they sound funny. I would love to watch them.
I love Mila Kunis.
I saw that last month, it was hilarious.

Thanks for your help!
Thanks, bye!
Hi! What sorts of movies are you into?
Same, plus sci-fi and fantasy. Have you seen [ITEM] ?
I thought so. The end credits scene makes yo wonder about the next film.
Have you seen [ITEM] ? The newest one/?
I saw that. I didnt like it as much as the originals. It seemed to be reaching to me.
It's like they're trying to find ways to keep John alive because they regret having killed him off in the previous series.
I did! I was hoping for somewhat of a different story, but I liked what they've done so far. Skarsgard (SP??) was great as Pennywise.
Agreed! It was typical, American official fucks over the world to win petty war, lol
The submit button is lit. Do we end here?
Same here. Night!
Hi

Ken foree was in [ITEM] if you haven't seen it!

Those are all great suggestions, because they're movies I've actually never seen! I've only recently begun watching horror movies outside of halloween season.

Got one more for me by chance? :-)
I actually saw [ITEM] and it was intense! Almost too much, but I liked it because it actually scared me, legitimately!
I never saw the second (or third?) ones, have you? I'm not sure if they're any good.
Or what they're called if they exist
Alright cool, I can find them on IMDB I'm sure, thanks for the recommendations!

Hello.
I really like horror movies, with paranormal themes.
Oh yeah! That was a really good one. The ending was a major twist.
I didn't see that one. I wasn't really big on the Exorcist movies for some reason.
It was pretty good. I wasn't too big of a fan of the second one, but the third one, [ITEM] was really good.

All I can think of hearing that movie title is &quot;period blood&quot;
lol
Same here!
That's another great one I haven't seen in ages
Maybe even since it premiered!
That's one that I wanted to watch after seeing Juno, but never got around to it
I'll have to add it to the queue if it's available on anything to stream!
That's another one I haven't seen yet either...
I'll have to see if my partner would want to snuggle up with a blanket and watch it tonight!
I think most definitely so! I really appreciate all of your suggestions!

And thanks again!

I hope your having a good night. Have you seen any interesting drama or horror movies lately?

It is one of my favorite movies. I don't even know what to compare it to honestly.
I have not seen [ITEM] . I'll check it out.
Wow. It must be a great movie. Movies that trigger real emotions are always the best.
I have seen that one. I really enjoyed it. it sort of reminds me of [ITEM] but I just couldn't bring myself to feel involved in [ITEM] . I felt guilty when I had no interest in it.
I will check out your other suggestions. Thanks for your help.

I was thinking about a good mystery movie?

thriller is even better
Especially psychological thrillers

Hi
Happy new year
I love drama movies, for example some of my favorite are [ITEM] or [ITEM] with Nicole Kidman
Basically anything with a really good story line like [ITEM] with Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood, that one was amazing
Any suggestions
Yes I have and I really loved it, but I feel like all the marvel movies are more action than drama
Any other suggestions? Like [ITEM] that one was such a sad movie with Whoopi and Oprah
Or [ITEM] with Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio.
I have but again, that one was more action with Charlize Theron
A good movie with some action but is more drama are movies like [ITEM] with Tom hanks
There is action but its more of a drama.
Okay well thanks.
Goodbye

Hi there.
I'm in the mood for a good horror film this evening.
Something like the classic slasher films from the 80s.
What's that about?
Or what is it similar to?
Can never go wrong with Freddy. :)
And the inferno film sounds like it might give my girlfriend the creeps. I'll see if Amazon has it for rental. :)
I've seen [ITEM] . But not the first.
So I've heard. But that shouldn't surprise me. The originals are always better.
Unless it's a sequel done by James Cameron, then all bets are off. :D

[ITEM] looked good, what did you not like about it?
Ohh....those are good ones. I'm watching [ITEM] right now and it's horrible.
I'll definitely check that one out!
Ehh....I lived in a small town when [ITEM] came out and by the time it made it to our theater I'd already seen all the parodies of it. And it was in a theater full of people who screamed and freaked out. I think If I'd seen it earlier then I'd have liked it.
LOL
I wasn't really a fan of [ITEM] either. Yes, I think so. This is my first time doing these, so I'm still learning the process.
Well, it was nice talking to you. Get some rest and have a good day.

Yes, I've seen [ITEM] . I wonder why they don't make horror films as suspenseful anymore.

It's way better than I make it sound. ;)
If you have seen [ITEM] then you might know of Karen Gilan. Her charachter is main focus of the movie.
You should watch the movie regardless of the trailer. Sometimes trailers are misleading. I haven't seen the trailer so I don't know.

A lot of good ones have died these past years.

[ITEM]
fantasy
how about u
not really
those sound good
I'm fine. My movie tastes tend to run towards mindless violence.
I'm a person that thinks [ITEM] is a Christmas movie.
I have not seen that.
Vince Vaughn is shady. I think it's the perpetual circles under his eyes.
I also like thriller/murder mysteries. Big fan of any of the Grisham movies. Especially the one with the dead Renfro guy.
Low budget violence is super fun. [ITEM] was interesting.
You should check out the youtube video with the theme song. David Hasselhoff sings it. It's funny.
I haven't seen the new [ITEM] though.

&quot;sighs&quot;.... I have not. I'm so embarrassed, lol.
I am one of those people who used to dismiss older movies because of the quality of film making, but as I've grown older, I see that they often tell much better stories than films today
My son's seen them all. Swears they're good horror without a lot of cheesey special effects.
Well he swears they're aawesome, lol. And these are good. I think I have enough to work with .
Thank you so much!

Yes, we liked that one. We liked all of that world.
That does look good, and I think some of them have read the book.

Superheros are good, but definitely not rated R, and I'd have to check out a PG13 to see why it got that ratiang.
I know it won awards. I will have to see the trailer.
Thanks for the sugesions.

Both of those are great films
I love fried green tomatoes.
Is that a remake of the original [ITEM] ?
I don't think I owuld watch it. since I saw the original.
I don't think they should have remade that film.
I am a little bias with remakes.
[ITEM] was a good remake.

I agree.
They did , thanks.

Any sports is fine by me!
Definitely. New or old movies, it doesn't matter to me.

That sounds pretty funny. Charlie Sheen is excellent, no doubt.
I have not heard of that one either!
Is it funny? It sounds like it could be humorous.
I have! It is hilarious. I love Bill Murray!
I think that solves my issues. Thanks so much! I will check those out.

Hi.
Well, I need to take some younger teens on an outing to the theater. Something like [ITEM]
It doesn’t have to be G, and PG is better. Pg13 is probably too much unless I knew exactly why it got that rating.
I liked that, and some of them like [ITEM] as well.
I really wanted something in the theaters this weekend.
Do you know the rating for that?
I want something all parents involved will be okay with.
There are some boys, and though I liked [ITEM] I dont think i can convince them to to to that.
That seems good.
Who doesn't like gnomes?

Hello, I am looking to pick a movie for date night next weekend. Maybe something new coming out.
We saw [ITEM] and liked it.
I read the book as a teen and it was not a favorite of mine. I think I will skip the scary clowns.

Action movies usually just have guys rescuing women.

I think [ITEM] is our best bet, but I will look at the [ITEM] trailer too.
The book is about a bull who smells flowers.

Okay, I am looking for good thrillers, do you think you could help with some suggestions?
I love the suspense and twists that you get in thrillers, like [ITEM] jep
[ITEM]
Or murder mysteries in [ITEM] with Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.

Can you recommend thriller movies for that genre?
More horror/paranormal, but that movie is okay. Not a big fan
Any other suggestions?
That is a good thriller, I enjoyed that movie a lot.
Understandable, Anthony Hopkins does a really good job portraying that character.
I mean he is a cannibal so I am sure he has a mental illness.
But thanks for the suggestions. Have a good day. Goodbye.

Yeah a little bit. I ended up figuring out what happened before the end.
[ITEM] was awesome!
It was pretty suspenseful and a little creepy but very well played out.
The eeriness of it. Also the depiction of the aliens and how they kinda seemed like squids that make whale noises.
She's been recruited by the government to figure out what the aliens want so she's carrying her tools of the trade up there to learn their language
I didn't really care for those films. They just didn't interest me.
Those I wasn't a fan of either. Too much action

Have a good one!
I loved that one!

I want something in the theater this weekend.
I like British movies, especially ones based on old books, one of my favorites was Sense and Sensibility (1995).
I mean [ITEM]
[ITEM] was good too.
If there aren't any based on old British books or plays a drama would be fine.
What is it about? Midnight sun suggest Alaska or the poles.
I did like [ITEM] I liked the book as a kid.
That sounds nice. I've even heard of that disease.
Thanks for the suggestion. I will check it out.
Bye.

Hi. How are you
I am looking for a movie that has suspense and is thrilling but not with gore
I am seeking a movie that makes me sit on the edge of my seat but not scare me to death
I like the [ITEM] and the [ITEM] but not the others you mentioned
I don't want to see a demonized doll. I rather see people handling usually situations that give you suspense
Having object come to life and terrorize people is too much. There is enough things in life that can give you heart a jolt not objects.

They like the usual Disney and have seen [ITEM] at home
And of course they cant let it go with [ITEM]
[ITEM] is probably too old for them and they liked [ITEM] so I want something else.
Are both of those animated and rated G?
If something was PG i's have to know why it was PG first, but it might be okay.
Maybe I'll check out both of those trailers, and see what is up. Thanks for the sugesions.

I don't think I've seen that one.
I was just talking with my friend about the first horror movie I saw, [ITEM] lol
As odd as it was, I liked [ITEM] too
I agree, they've outplayed the series, and the story.
Mine hated horror movies, it was torture getting them to let me watch anything they rated too risky.
But I did like all of the [ITEM] movies.
You as well! Thanks so much!

Hello
I am looking for a good spy movie
I have seen it. I liked that movie.
I was thinking something like tom hanks [ITEM]
What is that?
remember in the new pirates of the carribean [ITEM] , the spanish Kaptain refers to jack as &quot;da sparrow&quot; ..like the batman
that was cool
He's looking for &quot;the sparrow&quot;, a young jack sparrow
how about in the new pirates, the captain bad guy was actually a spanish officer of the royal navey, not even a pirate
boom!
they did CGI on johnny depp and made him look like a 19yr old scally wah
wag*
I guess I like [ITEM] much less than the others
I will try some of the movies you told me to watch, they are good, indeed

Tell me a good modern horror movie?
Seen it, love it. Good call!
[ITEM]
It has Barbra Streisand as kind of an accident-prone young lady and she falls for a neurotic doctor.
There's some slapstick and lots of quick wit. It's great!
Have you seen anything similar?
Yeah, that's a pretty solid one.
I think I would put [ITEM] among my favorite comedies too.
I love that one.
What's the weirdest movie you've ever seen?
Probably [ITEM] QUITE bizarre and disturbing.

Hi.
☺
A good thriller. Recent if possible.
Maybe a foreign flick I haven't actually seen.
That was a good one. I think that was Australian (?)
Yes. Not bad. [ITEM] was actually pretty scary though.
You like really scary movies.
How about [ITEM] ?
It's almost too scary for a lot of people.
It's funny how they keep trying to make exorcism movies and they are never scary, except that one.
[ITEM] was kind of scary though.
Also a true story.
It's not something you want to really contemplate.
Yes. Not so much scary as just a good plot. The bully kid was scarier than the monster.
[ITEM] is another decent Stephen King movie recently.
Well it's been great chatting with you.

i loved Bridesmaides. It was hilarious
I love him too, he's very funny
I have not seen the new one, only the original [ITEM]
i have seen previews of the new one and it looks lame
maybe because I figured the original was so good I feel like it is hard to re-make it any other way
sometimes remakes can be very bad
It's a funny movie about jealous bestfriends
[ITEM] is on netflix
bye

Can you tell me about [ITEM]
I guess I can check it out, thank you.

It's a real tear-jerker, especially if you have dogs.

So good. Now I'm frustrated to wait for the next half though.
Awesome. I loved [ITEM] .
Me too. It was a great movie as well.
I'm not sure. I get confused with those sometimes. There are so many. The only one I can remember clearly is [ITEM] but I think that is the wrong slasher film series.
Well, now I have some Romance and Horror films to watch. It's a surprisingly good combination.
I watched those all the time when I was a kid. My brother and I scared ourselves.
I hope your little ones feel better. Thanks for your help!

I've seen the entire HG series. Good but not really historical female figures.
Is [ITEM] an action flick?
I heard good things about it but it's really too bad Hollywood isn't making more films about real women

I'm actually looking for a film to watch with my boyfriend. I want to surprise him with pizza and a DVD.
He likes action type stuff, thrillers, pretty much any guy kind of stuff.
No, I haven't seen it! I'm pretty sure the bf hasn't either, so that sounds like a good choice!
I might want to pick a couple for backup, though.
We saw [ITEM] together and liked it. Can you think of any other super hero type stuff?
Or anything else you think might be good?
Oh, feel free to suggest anything else, too!
I think I saw [ITEM] a while back, but now I can't remember if I saw the ending. Maybe I fell asleep for that one. So I'll keep it in mind!
Thanks! I thought about making him watch something romantic like [ITEM] but I thought it might be nice to get something we could both enjoy. :)

Hello!
Hated seeing... Let's see.
Let me tell you what I like first.
Because you asked that first. :)
I like classic movies for sure.
And I like when they're remastered.
But classic cinema, even foreign, is a favorite of mine. Especially if they're classic.
I mean, 'celebrated' classics
So any Golden Era Hollywood flick.
Genre doesn't matter.
Gotta say I love [ITEM]
I just saw [ITEM]
And that last one was a milestone. Boo Radley. Scout.
Gregory Peck was a great actor.
I'd agree that [ITEM] was a worthy epic
I mean, the 1997 version
Kate and Leo
I can recite lines from that one.
Zuzu's Petals.
Hey Bert! My mouth is bleedin! Whoopeeeee!
Jimmy Stewart was huge
Good suggestions. I am going to go see what's on TCM

Its a really good movie about the first battle that took place in afghanistan against the Taliban after 9/11
You should see it!
Yes, I like those movies a lot. Another one I enjoyed was [ITEM] and [ITEM]
What do think about those?
[ITEM] is one of my favorites. I watched it like 10 times. And yes, American Sniper was emotional.

One of my favorite genres is SciFy.
I loved [ITEM]
Something for a guy and a gal is what I need.

[ITEM] was good for older kids and for adults too. the book was good.
Is the main character from [ITEM] a female?
If it is the one I am thinking of it is based on a video game. That sounds good. Action, but not guys just beating each other up.
I haven't seen that either, but I would kike to as it won lots of awards.

Is that comedy?

Hi. I want to see an action film
Interesting. I would suggest a funny one like [ITEM]
I like to be able to laugh when watching a film but also be entertained by the action. [ITEM] sounds like buddy cop movie which is similar to the genre
What can you say about [ITEM] ?
I like the fact that these films are from a different era. I also love a bit of nostalgia. It sounds like [ITEM] may not have enough action for my liking
Wow! Would love to see how they pulled that off. Any stars in it?
Sounds exciting. Would you say it's family friendly?
It doesn't sound too bad. As long as there is an adult in the room anyway.
I did like [ITEM] but did think it was quite violent
It's good to hear that these ones are less so
These suggestions have been so helpful. I definitely appreciate your recommendations

I have seen [ITEM] and it was very good! Do you have any recommendations on thrillers, maybe?
I've seen [ITEM] and liked it well enough. Do you think you could give me one more suggestion?
Okay, I'll check out [ITEM] ! Thank you so much for the chat and your help today.

I'm in the mood for a good heroine today. :)
No I have not.
That's the one about her adopting the black kid right?
I'll rent it tonight.
I did see that. It made me cry and laugh throughout.
I tried to watch that but couldn't. It was too sad for me. I was overweight in my early 20s and it brought back so many memories.
Is that the one based on the novel of the same name?
Yeah that's the one. I've read the book and loved it but I've never seen the movie.
I can only imagine. I cried through the entire book
I've seen it. Love that movie. :) I watch it every valentines day, lol
She was. :)
These are good. I've already bought a few off Amazon to watch this weekend.
Thanks for the help and the convo!

Hello
I am looking for a thriller or a comedy.
I also like movies that involve chefs and cooks.
I saw [ITEM] and I liked that.
Those were both interesting movies.
Sometimes, indie movies are better than the reviews state. That is how [ITEM] was.
Have you ever watched a cooking movie?
It's a fad now. They have shows and movies about all kinds of cooks.
Disney channel used to have some pretty good shows. I haven't watched that channel in forever, but I bet it was good.
Maybe, I will watch that. There's nothing like a light-hearted comedy.
Thank you for the suggestions.
You too.

Ok! I think we're all done!
Thanks for your time and take care!
Hi. I'm looking for movies that have some connection with mathematics, if that makes sense.
Oh, good choice. I was amused when Matt Damon solved the 'unsolvable' problem.
Wasn't that Ramanujan in that film?
Was he also in Jay and Silent Bob? Kevin Smith makes great movies, IMO!
There was also a movie I saw a couple years ago -- I'm forgetting the name -- but it's where these aliens come to earth and communicate with, like, giant ink blots.
Yes, I remember [ITEM] : it was suprisingly deep for a Nic Cage movie.
Yes, these were useful suggestions: thanks for helping me!
Good night.

LMAO! Yeah I'm here. :)
It is. So about those movies, [ITEM] was good. Other than the villain winning what did you like?
I agree. I thought Eddie Norton's character was a real victim. Until the ending, lol.
In a way, it was almost like [ITEM] with Matthew Mcconoughy (however you spell it)
I thought so. It's not as gritty as [ITEM] but it's got just an interesting of a story.
Have you seen [ITEM] Dragon? With Eddie Norton and Anthony Hopkins?
He does. I've seen most all his movies except for [ITEM] .
Oh okay. Maybe that's why I've never seen it.
Was he in [ITEM] ?
Is it? I didn't know that.
lol Same here. Nice chatting with you.
Anything really
Im open
OK. I can check that out.
What else do you have?
Yeah, maybe not that one then lol.
Those sound pretty. I did see fight club though
So I'm interested.

I love Joseph Gordon Levitt
I will check it out the next time I have the time to watch a movie

It is a great Halloween movie.
All right, tell me one more.
Let me hear it
Something that maybe has been released in the last two years

All right, partner, I appreciate your insight.

I want to watch a futuristic movie

I also saw [ITEM] and thought that was really good- I'm a huge fan of Disney movies.
I did try to watch [ITEM] but I only got half way through it, I didn't like it as much.
Oh, [ITEM] is a great suggestion! I love that movie but I'm so willing to watch it again and again.
Do you think [ITEM] will be a good movie to watch when it comes out next week?
I agree. I think I'll enjoy it a lot, and if that's true I'll look into more Afro-futurism movies going forward.
Thanks for your help!

Hello.
I am having a good evening, thanks. I hope you are as well. I'm trying to find some new movies to watch in either horror or drama.
Sure. I recently watched [ITEM] and it was great. I loved [ITEM] but I realize I'm not going to find anything like it. That movie was a class of its own.
I watched it years ago. I would definitely enjoy refreshing my memory though. Stephen King movies are normally very good. I know its more of a cult classic than mainstream but I could watch [ITEM] over and over again.
I never watched that one but I read the book. I will check it out. Thank you.
You too. Bye.

low budget version of pacific rim, it probably sucks
No, i heard that movie bombed at the box office. I did see [ITEM] and Hugh jackman is in that as well. He plays the villain.

How are you?
I haven't seen a good documentary in a LONG time. I generally prefer historical or environmental docs, but I can look into others as well.
I'm not sure if I've seen that one. Is the about the orcas in Japan?
Oh wait, I'm thinking [ITEM] (which is a good one if you're into animal rights docs, but it's got a sad ending). I haven't seen [ITEM] but I'd be down to give it a try.
Is there any animation you can recommend?
Not necessarily documentaries, mind you, lol.
Yes, I've see Fahrenheit 9/11.
It was pretty good.
Oops, forgot to at the &quot;at&quot; symbol.
...or spell.
I've seen all three and I've loved them all, especially [ITEM] (or anything from Studio Laika).

Like you wanted to walk out of the theater, but couldn't.
Or you were trapped watching it and couldn't escape.
I did, and I liked it. But I realize it's not for everyone. You kinda have to be from the empty Western US states to 'get it'. I do live the next state over from ID.
To someone from New Jersey, it would be an alien culture.
That movie is about Mormons.
Mormon way of life. Never mentioned at all in the movie, but it's abundantly clear to people who know.
Sorry, didn't mean to be a pest there.
Ah, okay say no more.
Heh. Now that's the religion I'm familiar with. :D
It was painful indeed.
I did. The beach scene with the ocean perch in his rear end cheeks.
Made me wanna leave.
It is kinda Tel Aviv-y
Is that the one that iTunes gave away for free? With the kids?
It's like zero out of five stars.
Let that be a lesson to them I guess
My offering is for [ITEM]
It's a Robin WIlliams film so you might stumble across it and think it might be good. It is so lousy that it will give you gas.
It's old, but was supposed to have been a landmark musical. Cost a fortune to make. Try to imagine a musical based around the Popeye cartoon character.
The whole movie is singing.
BAD singing.
hehhe
I agreee
night
hello im looking for a good horror movie

Mel Gibson and it was about the American Revolution War with Great Britian.

Hi
Do you know anything about good dance movies?
I loved [ITEM]
I liked that one, but anything a bit more dramatic?
that's a bit more of a silly one. I'm looking for something about real dancers
I guess but it's more about dancing as a plot device. How about a documentary about dancing?
I guess. anything newer?
ok, I'll give it a look.
I will like to know if you know of any sci fi movie like [ITEM]
I am not sure, but it seems I have seen them before
Okay, I will add that to my list too. It sounds catchy
Hello
I am fine and you?
I like psychological thrillers!
Have you seen [ITEM]
Yes, I like [ITEM]
I did not like [ITEM]
I saw [ITEM] a long time ago and don't remember the movie. I guess it was not that memorable.
Have you seen [ITEM]
Thank you for the recommendations. I think I will try those out!
You too!
Hi there!
Are you looking for a movie recommendation?
Sounds good! If there are no children watching, I would recommend [ITEM] the original or you could watch [ITEM] for a comparison.
Now for a true comedy - I just watched [ITEM] PHENOMENAL!
I'm not much for action movies, but the hubster and kids drag me to watch every [ITEM] and Marvel movie.
Would you like a few more recommendations?
Alrighty - how about changing it up a bit and watch an HBO special? [ITEM]
WAY FUNNY and generally very clean
Cool! Well have a fun Saturday vegging out!!
:)
I'm good I want to watch a Tarantino movie
He wrote it I think but didn't direct it
I'd rather see something he directed
I didn't like that one

WIth Daniel Day Lewis? I heard amazing things about that one
I also heard the director has worked with Day-Lewis on his latest film
I saw [ITEM] a few years ago and loved it so much. Jamie Foxx slays that role haha
Thank you so much and I think i'll watch [ITEM] tonight

I was thinking [ITEM]
Thaks, Have a good day.
Do you know any good ones staring Vin Diesel?
I have him in his [ITEM] movies.
No. But I have seen him [ITEM]
I have seen about the fist 30 minutes of it.Haha! All three times I've seen it come on.
[ITEM] was good too.
I keep meaning too but every time it comes on something comes up and I'm not able to see it.
Me too.

Hello! This is my first time in Movie Chat!
What is your favorite movie of all time? Mine is [ITEM]
I love Science Fiction movies.
That's a really good one. Sarah Connor is such an amazing character. I just re-watched [ITEM] a couple of days ago. It feels so hollow without her in it. Arnold is the star, but Linda Hamilton is really what made [ITEM] and [ITEM] such compelling films.
The original [ITEM] is my favorite by far, but [ITEM] and [ITEM] are wonderful too.
I don't particularly like the prequel trilogy, [ITEM] and [ITEM] are especially bad.
It's OK, it's growing on me, but the new trilogy lacks some of the gravitas of the first trilogy.
Now the stand alone Star Wars movies look very promising. [ITEM] was excellent, and I have high hopes for the upcoming Han Solo movie.
Sorry, machete order?
Interesting, I may have to do that. I have al of the [ITEM] films on iTunes.
Oh! Clever!
Hmmm I wonder how [ITEM] would work as a flashback... after [ITEM] the original?
I will do that. Thank you so much for the recommendation!
I think we have mentioned enough movies now, thanks for the chat!
Hello, I am looking for a good comedy movie.
I'm OK.
I have seen [ITEM] but not the latter - I don't think I'm interested in that.
I've seen [ITEM] but not [ITEM] What is that about?
What is [ITEM] about?
I haven't seen [ITEM] I may take a look. I think you might be confusing [ITEM] with [ITEM] I saw that, it was okay.
Yes.
Thank you for your suggestions, goodbye!
I like to watch action movies.
I like the movie [ITEM]
It was really interesting to see how well the film presented.
No I had not.
Is that Marvel?
Is that Marvel?
Do you have another suggestion?
No I have not seen that one.
I've seen [ITEM]
It was kind of interesting.
I might check into it.
Bye
Hey pal!
Good you? Do you know any good cartoons for kids?
Oh yes I love those! My kids will too I'm sure.
Any others?
We have already seen [ITEM] and they loved it.
Same here haha. You are so lucky!
If I get anymore movie night will go into tomorrow and the kiddos will never go to bed.
Thank you. Bye.
I like Drama and action
Can you recommend some?
I have. I loved it. It was quite intense
I've not seen [ITEM]
[ITEM] I've seen twice.
Oh Cool I like Russel Crowe
I like stuff like [ITEM] too
Hah I loved [ITEM] . I was at the edge of my seat through it all
I know ! I'm scared of heights I could never do it !
[ITEM] is hilarious !
I couldn't stop laughing in that one
Its been good chatting with you. I think I'm ready to sign off

[ITEM] and [ITEM] are some of my favorite movies
I have seen those, both really good choices

Hi
I'm looking for something that is similar to [ITEM]
I also really liked [ITEM]
and [ITEM]
[ITEM] is a movie about a computer that a guy falls in love with
[ITEM] seems like a horror movie. I am more interested in science fiction
Good suggestion
seems like we got that figured out
I thought that it was a little to &quot;action&quot; and not enough science, but it's OK
too*
Any other great science fiction you love?
[ITEM] is simply excellent
that would be a perfect suggestion
OK, i think we got some good suggestions.
goodbye
