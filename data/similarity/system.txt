Hope I could help, with movie suggestions.
Goodbye :D
Hi
What kind of movies do you like?
Have you seen [ITEM] or [ITEM]
They are very good. What about [ITEM]
Or [ITEM]
They are both good, I would say [ITEM] is better.
Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are in it

bye
Hi
Of course
The one's I mention I have seen and liked. How about [ITEM]
Yes, how about [ITEM]
Yes but there is also [ITEM] which was just released last year and is not animated
Hello. How are you tonight?
I'm doing well. What sort of movies do you normally prefer?
Those are both good movies. Have you ever seen [ITEM] or [ITEM]
I thought [ITEM] was a very good romance. Have you seen it?
[ITEM] is a romance, in a way, although there is a rather serious theme to the movie.
You're welcome. I hope you enjoy the movie.
Hello
Have you tried [ITEM] ?
Or [ITEM] is really good!
Also, [ITEM] is really good. Lots of action in that one.
I loved [ITEM] , very dramatic
Have you seen [ITEM] ?

I loved [ITEM] though it was torture to watch since I LOVE sushi!
Me too!!!!
haha. I have to admit though I haven't seen [ITEM]
wow, I wouldn't have ever thought of making a documentary about that.
Anyways, an old documentary you might have seen was [ITEM]

Hello, are you interested in any particular type of movie?
I would recommend movies like [ITEM] or [ITEM] then.
If you are looking for something a bit more unorthodox [ITEM] might work.
[ITEM] is a zombie movie, but it focuses on a kid that is learning to survive on his own. Then meets a girl and develops as an individual.
I could also recommend [ITEM] for another odd coming of age movie.
In this movie, a kid is in a post apocalyptic world and again meets a girl. I would tell you more, but I would hate to spoil this one. It is a gem.
I'm glad I was able to give you some new suggestions! Hope you enjoy them.

hey this is different, uhm, sci fi my favorite in the last 20 years is [ITEM] I loved the fight scenes and FX
I heard they are doing a reboot, but I hope not.
I&quot;ve heard mixed reviews about [ITEM] though
some people are against once Mark Hamil spoke out about the plot.
[ITEM] was pretty good. The tone switch from super serious Norse to comedy thru me for a bit though
on [ITEM] would you compare it more to [ITEM] where it was in the same universie but didn'nt feel the same or more like the other [ITEM] movies. Same here on [ITEM] although I kinda wish they didn't include Harrison Ford since the original kinda left it open if he was a replicant or not.
You two later and thanks

Hi there, what type of movies can I recommend to you?
so you like horror movies with a bit of humor? Have you ever seen [ITEM]
or [ITEM]
It is more horror, but personally, I find the gor a bit on the silly side.
[ITEM] is funny/scary
If you are looking for something more scary, have you seen [ITEM] ?
It is definitely a supernatural one, but it does get into your head. If you like the psychological side of the movies, it is a good one!
Great. Glad I could help you choose something. Enjoy your movie!
Bye!
Howdy!!
What type
have you seen [ITEM]
it is funny
yes [ITEM]
i also like [ITEM]
And the [ITEM] is always good too
Hi!
[ITEM] is a fantastic thriller, one of my favorites, but there isn't too much action. It's more psychological.
For an action/thriller, you could always try The Taking of Pellham 123. Either [ITEM] or the original it was based on, [ITEM]
[ITEM] is one of our Christmas movies!
I think I swapped the years incorrectly, but I think you know what I meant.
It was great chatting with you as well.

Hello, hope you're having a great day!
what movies are you looking for? Hit me.
I am a huge fan of [ITEM] , the remake
it's not even a guilty pleasure, it's a damn good movie
it's good. Similar humor to [ITEM] and an underdog story, but I'd argue a little more heartwarming and less slapstick
I heard very mixed things about that one. I haven't cared too much for Adam Sandler past [ITEM] , and even then that movie was just too sad for rewatching lol
thank you too, have a great day :)
Hello
What kind of movies are you looking for?
Action movie, got it
Have you seen [ITEM] or [ITEM] ?

So do you like stuff like [ITEM] ? I'm not a horror fan at all but seems most people like that one.
I think the last horror movie I saw was [ITEM] I didn't like it but I've heard people that like horror did.
I've heard people like [ITEM] movies a lot too!
I've also heard [ITEM] was a good one for horror fans.
YOu're welcome
I am doing great!
I hope you like movies, I sure do! I would like to know what kind you like.

Well, do you think that give you a headstart on movies then?
I hope so, take care too! Good bye.
HI, feeling like watching movies?
Excellent! both of them are of similar quality, but you might like [ITEM] 's original story. How old are the kids?
Lol! Know what you mean. So thinking of them [ITEM] is a top choice, but if you would like to make your home marathon, you can add [ITEM] after it, it wil be awesome!
That will make sure they fall asleep.. or ask for a third movie
Great! You will like the characters too
Glad to hear that!
Just add some popcorn and it will be a great evening!
wow, thanks, same to you. enjoy the movie!
I think they will also have the time to watch [ITEM] .. and maybe [ITEM] too

horror
foreign

Hello there kind stranger!
Action movies are always good. Can't beat a classic like [ITEM]
As far as modern flicks, you can always look to Liam Neison too.
Did you know that [ITEM] is actually a video game movie? It is based on the Payday game series.
Yeah, that one surprises most people I tell. :) There isn't really much story in the game is why, but John Wick is the main character.
Sure! I suppose my go-to action movie right now would have to be [ITEM] Not very inspired, I know. But solid film.
Alternatively, can't go wrong with the [ITEM] or [ITEM] series.
[ITEM] if you are just looking for fighting.
Okay! Take care!
Do look at that one. It is great.

how about [ITEM]
Laika’s latest stop-motion effort is an original story about a young protagonist who takes to the sea with help from a maternal figure reincarnated as an animal and a supposed legendary hero who also has a miniature version of himself along for the ride. Sound familiar? There’s also a scene where the good guys have to retrieve a special weapon from a cave guarded by a monster. And in the end, the main villain is not as evil as he seems.
or [ITEM]

[ITEM] was a good movie and really showed aspects of the man I never knew. It kind of turned me into a fan. His daughter and wife made brief appearances.
Another good one is [ITEM] it's a bit newer than This is Elvis.

Good evening.
Are you looking for something recent or something more contemporary?
Classic?
No worries. How do you feel about Shakespeare? I really like [ITEM] It's got David Tennant starring Hamlet.
Hamlet's been redone many times (Mel Gibson, Kenneth Branaugh), but my favorite is David Tennant's.
I just saw Midsummer's for the first time and I really enjoyed it. :)
If you're into classics, [ITEM] is a quintessintial classic. It's really long though.
If you like Bill Murray, I highly recommend [ITEM]

I just remembered another one. It's called [ITEM] . It stars the actor that was the lead in [ITEM]

One of my favorite movies is [ITEM] . I liked it so much I've watched it probably 6 or 7 times.
Cool. I hope you like them. I like dark comedies too and it is sometimes hard to find good movies of that sort.
I haven't. I will check it out though.

only matched by J-law falling down again this year

still ala carte, it is packing a punch with a lot of people
thank you.. have fun
enjoy watching
enjoy watching
night
good day
how may I help you ?
comedy is so subjective, do you mind giving me a couple ideas of what you found as a romantic comedy?
I have to say, even though much of her earlier work were in the comedy genre, as an adult, she's really moved into a heavy drama genre. It's good I think!
anyways
the first suggestion is NOT a Reese film but is funny, and that's [ITEM]
she did but then she went into the whole [ITEM] series.
anyway, if you like Reese and haven't seen [ITEM] and the sequel it's really light comedic watching.
A modern Reese comedy I'd say, would be [ITEM]
Sophia Vigara is in that too
ok, you too! happy Reese day!
Good evening!

yes, thrillers are great. [ITEM] is incredible. One of my all-time favorite movies
that's the Leo movie, right? I should check that out, I'm a fan of his
didn't care for [ITEM] all that much but he's generally great
awesome, have a great day. Check Ex Machina for sure!
Hi
what kind of movies do you like
Or do you have a favorite actor?
Have you seen [ITEM] ?
It's in a long line of sequels for [ITEM]
Will Smith just did [ITEM]
It was interesting
You may also enjoy [ITEM]
Try one of those movies
That's awesome
Enjoy one of those recommendations
bye
Hello, human. I mean, fellow human!
Speaking of which, know any good space movies?
I know a terrible one if you want a good laugh.
[ITEM] is so bad, it is funny.
I love the Alien series. I suppose there are the sequels but that is hardly insightful.
The television series The Expanse is currently where I fill that gap in my life. Though that isn't a movie.
I didn't know that. How about [ITEM] for a one off night joke movie.
I used to pretend the headlights of cars were clown noses and shoot them with my cousin in the backseat. Memories!
It does seem like they rely on getting quiet and then jump scaring rather than suspense and being terrifying.
Not to mention the ongoing issue of just repeating the same story over and over.
Truly! [ITEM] was a thousand times better than [ITEM]
Have you seen the latest Star Wars film [ITEM] I haven't gotten around to it yet.
[ITEM] [ITEM] and [ITEM] were the best the 80s produced! Outside of the slew of ski movies I like as a guilty pleasure.
And with that! I must leave. Hope to see you around!
Did you see [ITEM]
It was a great film. if you're into science fiction I recommend it.
What have you seen that is good lately?
There is a new [ITEM] starring Bruce Willis.
yeah it looks really good
Have you seen [ITEM] I thought it was okay.
[ITEM] is a genuine classic? All of the first 3, anyway.
No problem.
Good-bye.
Hello, Can I help you find a movie?
[ITEM] Is a great movie if they are dog lovers
also [ITEM] is a nice movie that most kids really enjoy.
Is there any particular that you have liked and I can try to think of some similar?
The [ITEM] was also very good but they recently modernized it, I did enjoy the older one better tho.
If you liked [ITEM] then check out [ITEM]
Goodbye, hope you enjoy.
I can recommend a movie for you. Tell me what you like.
What movie do you want to see? I have many in my catalog!
Drama, huh? How about [ITEM]
Poor people and irishmen as far as the eye can see...
What other drama movie are there. Let me think now... How about [ITEM] ?
That movie was actually pretty good. The ending was very simple and to-the-point.
If you want a secret agent movie, try one of the lesser know James Bond films... [ITEM]
Timothy Dalton
That has drama.
The drama is the fuse on timothy dalton's short-lived film career lol..
Any other film you like? Genres, etc?
No problem. Good to see you.
[ITEM] would be a very good choice, what are you looking for specifically?
[ITEM] is alright, although it is more of a thriller at the end.
Well yes but I also recommend you first watch [ITEM] before you watch [ITEM] , so that way you can make a comparison.
Also have you seen [ITEM] , it is definitely worth it, since its based on a true story.
You are welcome!
Hello. What sort of recommendations are you looking for?

Hello!
What kind of movie can I help you find?
Have you seen [ITEM] with Hugh Jackman yet?
It's a good musical.
If you like musicals it is worth the watch.
[ITEM] and [ITEM] are both sequels and pretty funny.
I also recommend [ITEM] the remake. I was surprised at how much I laughed at that.
It is, but it turned out to be super funny because of the new scenario and twist. It is really worth the time and good for everyone.
Hope I helped. And that you have a great movie day!

Oh ok, I am not sure what teen type movies are out. Sorry about that!
Hopefully you have fun though. Have a good day. bye!
Hi! What type of movies do you prefer&gt;
Ok. Hmm. This is a bit difficult for me. I could suggest [ITEM] although I did not like it.
Very disjointed in a way that I found boring. I was wondering if my younger self would have found it profound. However, I can always throw back to [ITEM] Or [ITEM]
I am not that old.
A bad movie can be fun. And a good documentary like [ITEM] can be frightening.
How about [ITEM] ? Did you see that? Sadly, I din't think the creators went on to much success with other films.
Yikes. The drop down menu has that misspelled!
That's an interesting timeline. I had never thought of the time effect. Should we say good-bye?
Me too. I am very jet lagged from returning from a vacation in Asia so my thinking skills might be a bit impaired.
You were a lot of fun and made my tired brain think! Have a great day! Bye!
Hi, how can I help you today?
hi
great, what are some movies you like?

there is also [ITEM]
about cross generational same gender lovers
you may like [ITEM]
more or a classic light love story

I'm typing but its not updating
..........
Let's see. That all depends on what it is you're in the mood for. Any particular genre or time period?
Okay then. First up I have [ITEM] with NEve Campbell.
The girl from [ITEM]
It's about two high school girls who accuse a counselor of rape and seduce a cop. Pretty wild movie
lol
I would also suggest [ITEM] . It's a sci-fi movie set in Johanesburg (sp) South Africa. An alien race arrives and they are treated rather cruelly.
Another sci-fi film is [ITEM] . It's less aliens and space craft and more a dystopian drama about the world after everyone has gone sterile.
Clive Owen is in it.
And for a bit of old school horror I'll suggest [ITEM] . It's an old Tales from the Crypt film
It was pretty hilarious, lol. The Crypt Keeper was hilarious.

Hi
What kind of movies do you like?
I really liked [ITEM] and [ITEM] they're different kinds of movies but both action filled.
It's a mercenary movie, lots of action
[ITEM] is action filled, but it's a disaster movie
gotcha
the [ITEM] series is non stop action
as well as [ITEM]
I haven't seen a bond movie in years. The 70's ones are the best [ITEM] is good
imho
have a good one
I am doing great! Yo?
I hear Annihilation is pretty good
A biologist signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition where the laws of nature don't apply
There is also Winchester, true story about a haunted house in San Francisco. The house was built by Sarah Winchester hieress to the gun manufacturer
It has rooms that go nowhere
Apparently she kept building on to the house to appease the people that died from being show with the guns
No, It's called Winchester
Stars Helen Mirren
I've not heard of that. I don't go to many movies anymore
Hello! How are you today?
Doing well, thank you. What kind of movies are you looking for today?
If you're looking for a great comedy, assuming you are okay with some adult humor and religious irreverence, I highly recommend [ITEM]
It also has Jason Bateman.
It's quite good. Also stars Alan Rickman. Slightly dark, more than slightly irreverent, but very funny and very good!
Excellent!
I have not seen that one yet.
I'll have to look it up myself, thank you!
Hey there!

Hello, how are you this evening
Have you seen [ITEM]
How about [ITEM]
Your welcome
Hello. I am doing well. Yourself?
Is there anything specific you are looking for?
The last movie I watched that I really enjoyed was [ITEM] although I was a little late to the game with that.
I was surprised at how much I liked it. I also watched [ITEM] recently and enjoyed it as well.
Exactly. I didn't watch it because I was not a fan of other DC movies. I'm much more of a marvel fan. [ITEM] is still one of my favorities.
That wasn't one of the best, in my opinion. I think you should watch anyway though so you don't miss any pieces of the story. I watched [ITEM] recently in preparation for their merge with the Avengers as well.
You're welcome. The Joker in that movie was awesome. I hope you enjoy it.
Hi, how can I help?
[ITEM] might be one you'd like.
Not sure what you are referring to?
No, I don't think so.
In 2002, two rival Olympic ice skaters were stripped of their gold medals and permanently banned from men's single competition. Presently, however, they've found a loophole that will allow them to qualify as a pairs team.
There is also [ITEM]

The best by far is [ITEM] . It is a timeless classic that will have you on the edge of your seat
Or [ITEM] but I'm sure you've probably seen that one
The Anatomy of Murder is a trial of a murder mystery with Duke Ellington and Jimmy Stewart
I haven't seen A perfect Murder so I can't really compare the two
There's also [ITEM] . I actually just saw it the other day. I was happily surprised with how tasteful it is
Agreed. Both great mysteries that don't move too slow
I hope I helped you find something!
Have a great day and have a Happy New Year
Hello!
Have you seen [ITEM] by chance? I just watched it the other night, and it's a pretty funny flick
As far as action, you can't go wrong with [ITEM] !
[ITEM] is a great mix of comedy and action, if you like BBC style comedy :)
The entire [ITEM] series is wonderful!
[ITEM] is great, but you may need subtitles if you don't do so well with accents, like myself lol
Going back a ways, [ITEM] is another great action comedy combo!
Of Course! I hope they satisfy your movie watching needs!
Have a great day ;)
hi
How about [ITEM] . It has Hugh Jackman in it too, if you like him singing
I did like Hugh Jackman in all the [ITEM] movies.
Here's one that might surprise you, [ITEM] Hugh Jackman played a typical role for him, but the movie, I thought was really inspirational. I was also based on a true story.
That's neat! One more , have you seen [ITEM] ? That one is really good too! It's a bit futuristic with robots. It's a bit of a tear jerker.
Have a lovely day!
Happy New year!
I heard that [ITEM] was funny
Comedy is not my kind of movie...what about [ITEM] ?
It's about moms acting badly...typical

Somewhere in the near future, single people are sent to 'the hotel', where they have 45 days to pair up with someone. If they fail, they're turned into an animal of their choosing. This is one of those films that people will either love, or absolutely loathe. But to me, it's a classic. Made by Yorgos Lanthimos, the same man who gave us the disturbing Dogtooth, The Lobster is in a way an extreme mirror to as dark a romantic film can get.
or if you are okay with subtitles there is [ITEM]
also foreign is [ITEM]
great,

if you want a classic, there is always [ITEM]

What about [ITEM] It's a classic Hitchcock film.
Oh yeah. I love the classics. Have you seen [ITEM] ?
No gore. It's a really good classic. It's about a woman that turns into a cat when she falls in love with a man and she ends up killing him.
Yeah, it is. She warned him not to make her fall in love, but he didn't listen. I assume you've probably seen the original [ITEM] ?
Oh wow. You definitely need to. Bela Lugosi is so good as Dracula.
Oh yeah, definitely. A more recent one that you might like is [ITEM]

[ITEM] is a quite excellent drama I just watched, really got the tear ducts working.
It's a romance drama with Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. Great film!
Another one I just saw was [ITEM] . It is kind of a three hour long chase scene, which in theory might sound dumb, but it is actually pretty cool.
You'll love it then!

Hello, how are you today? I'm you're (unqualified) movie recommender!
Is there anything in particular you are looking for, or should I just start naming movies I like and why?
Well, to start, I'd like the recommend [ITEM] for it's sci-fi themes, though it's better to think of people as computers as it was originally intended.
If you're looking for some action [ITEM] has perhaps the best mix of music and action with it's Black Sabbath scene.
[ITEM] is an animated feature that is great for questioning your own biases.
[ITEM] is a great (corny) film if you want to watch Alec Baldwin as a &quot;dark&quot; superhero.
He's a great straight-man kind of comedic actor.
Well, that's a list that should get you going. Have a nice day!
Hello there.

Too bad the sequel [ITEM] was so awful

I'm sure I can think of a few.
What kind of movies do you like
Oh good, a diverse taste. Let's see...have you seen [ITEM] starring Scarlett Johansson?
[ITEM] is a great mafia type movie that stars Leonardo DiCaprio. I really enjoyed that one.
I have, it's pretty funny.
A more recent mafia style movie is [ITEM] with John Travolta. I heard it's good as well.
But if you're more in the mood for Drama, I have one last suggestion for you to try [ITEM] Those movies are very intense.
Excellent, I hope you enjoy one of those suggestions. Take care and have a good night!

Hey there! How's it going?
I'm doing okay. Have you by any chance seen the sequels [ITEM] and [ITEM]
I enjoyed the first one the most, but felt it the others were worth mentioning.
Have you seen the new [ITEM] yet? I thought that was a similar style of comedy.
Otherwise if you're willing to go back over 20 years, I'd always recommend [ITEM]
Yeah, it's a much different style of comedy than the original so it might just be your thing!
Definitely check it out. That and [ITEM] are my two favorite comedies.

As far as live action goes, I really enjoyed the new [ITEM]
If you liked [ITEM] you will love [ITEM]

Okay great. Thank you and see you later. Goodbye.
Hello! How are you?
What kind of movie are you interested in today?
If you are thinking along the lines of Christmas, you should try the classic film [ITEM]
Yes it is. It's about a young boy named Ralphie, who attempts to convince his parents, his teacher and Santa that a Red Ryder BB gun really is the perfect Christmas gift. His father keeps telling him &quot;you'll shoot your eye out, kid&quot;
Still along the Christmas lines, [ITEM] is another great choice. Very funny and witty!
You're welcome!
Enjoy!
Good morning! How are you?
How do you feel about comic book movies?
I loved [ITEM] but I haven't seen [ITEM]
Have you seen the new [ITEM]
I enjoyed it. I loved Wonder Woman in it, but I was also surprised at how well they did Cyborg (who is usually left out of Justice League stories half the time).
Have you seen [ITEM] I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best. :)
No problem. Have a great day!
Hi
Sure.
Oh, that's a good one.
I like [ITEM]
and [ITEM] haunting movie
Yes it really was.
Did you see [ITEM] ?
It's not for everyone.
I liked it too.
And [ITEM] is pretty good
I wouldn't have thought Keanu had it in him
But he even did another one.
Sure
Good evening!
In that case, you'll probably love [ITEM] with Michael Fassbender. It's like [ITEM] but a little more gore.
I would also recommend [ITEM] with Jeremey Rener. It's about a murder mystery on an indian reservation. Pretty dark and psychological.
It kind of reminds me of [ITEM] if you've ever seen it.
Hi. Have you seen Batman?
Ok. There are movies like [ITEM] and [ITEM]
Good action in those. Let me think of a couple more.
[ITEM] and this one has parts 1, 2, and 3.
Do you like any other type of movies?
Okay. Great. Good bye

he was great in [ITEM] too
there's an older one called [ITEM]
I don't think he's much into comedies
and [ITEM] is a comedy with him
[ITEM] is about a bunch of young people who pursue the life of luxury by trying to become actors, singers, etc
and [ITEM] is about a player who tries to get his best friend to fall for him
yes, he really puts himself into each role
I hope I helped you today

Off the top of my head, [ITEM] is a pretty popular one, that I think fits that similar description. A newer one would be [ITEM] starring Emma Watson. I really liked that one, it was pretty moving at times.
It's super good! I'm sure you'll love it. Another one is [ITEM] , have you seen that one?
Yep they are the main characters. It is a good drama with some great humor as well.
I hope I was able to help!
Have a good one!

Hello. How is your night going?
Do you have anything in mind you would like to get suggestions for?
The first one that comes to mind is [ITEM] but I'm not sure if that is what you mean
[ITEM] came to mind as well but I don't think that is actually a sports movie. One second while I think of some others.
That's what I figured. I'm not sure if I have ever actually watched a movie focused on the game itself. Is [ITEM] along the lines of what you're thinking of?
I've never watched [ITEM] but some actual NBA athletes play themselves in the movie so it might be something you would like.
I've heard of that but haven't watched. The only other movie I can come up with is [ITEM] . I'm sorry I can't give better suggestions. I'm just not familiar with the subject. All I can think of are movies using sports as part of a larger plot.
Good Morning!
okay!
[ITEM]
[ITEM]
[ITEM] with tom cruise was good
I enjoyed [ITEM] with Bradley cooper
bye
I love comedies too. Have you ever seen [ITEM]

Can I help you find a movie?
I like comedies and romantic comedies. You?
Me too!
Have you seen [ITEM]
Absolutely hilarious. It has Jackie Chan, Billy Ray Cyrus and George Lopez.
[ITEM] and [ITEM] are both great.
Adam Sandler is in both of them and they realfunny.
Hello.
Happy new year.
How about [ITEM]
Or [ITEM]
All great movies.
How about [ITEM]
Yeah it’s one of the greats.
You might like [ITEM]
I really enjoyed it.
That’s right and he was definitely deserving of the Oscar.
I hope I helped.
Hello!
What kind of movies are you interested in?
Okay sure! Let me think..
[ITEM] is a pretty silly one, definitely worth a watch if you haven't already seen it.
[ITEM] is also very goofy, quite charming even if it doesn't stand up to the original.
Have you seen [ITEM] ?
It's similar to spy kids in that it is about spies, but it's a little different. Still a silly and fun movie.
It stars Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff. A childhood favorite movie!
I'm sure you'll like it- I hope I was of some assistance!
Hello! what type of movies are you looking for?
Have you seen [ITEM] ? its a continuation of the [ITEM] movies.
Another scary movie that isn't gorey is [ITEM] . the girl relives her death over and over until she solves it.
It was!! it kept my attention
one that i'm waiting to see that comes out in april is called [ITEM] with Lucy Hale. The commercial really caught my attention. I guess if you tell a Lie instead of the truth, you die.
No i haven't! I love his work. [ITEM] is my all time favorite of his
I haven't seen that one
I'll definitely have to!
you too! goodbye!

Hello! What type of movies do you like?
Did you want something to stream, or in the theater now?
Did you see [ITEM]
It was out last year so you can probably stream it now.
Some people have a problem with clowns though.
That was funny, as well as kind of creepy.
It was well received and won awards.
I think it was the whole movie. You could try the older vesion [ITEM] as well.
Glad I could be of help.
Bye.
Hello
Have you seen [ITEM] or [ITEM]
[ITEM] is a great one too
I actually consider [ITEM] a romantic movie..
You are very welcome.

Hmm, its and older one but [ITEM] is also good

Hi what kind of movie do you wan to see ?
If you like adam sandler you must have seen [ITEM] and [ITEM] ?
OK as for new comedies, have you seen [ITEM] ?
It fits your criterias
have you t [ITEM] it is also with adam sandler
and [ITEM] , but it is a more serious movie about a family
[ITEM] is a typical Adam Sandler movie
[ITEM] is more like [ITEM]
except Adam Sandler is more stable
Then you will like [ITEM]

A jim Carrey Film

Have you seen [ITEM]
Also [ITEM] Thor is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, and must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnarök, the destruction of his world, which is at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain Hela.
I did not personally watch [ITEM] but heard good things. They're releasing a sequel in May.
Yup, same thing I heard!
If all else fails, watch an uplifting comedy like [ITEM]
Hope you enjoy!
And OK you can pass on Sandler but you can't deny [ITEM] was a good movie.
hello!
what kind of movie are you looking for this evening?

Those two definitely have a Stranger Things type vibe, plus Mike from Stranger Things is in [ITEM] .
hm... let me think
What about [ITEM]
I know it's controversial, but I really enjoyed the new one :)
You're welcome! Hope this holds you over until Stranger Things 3!

Awesome. Going to run. Later!
Hi!
What kind of movies to you like?
Both are very talented! Have you seen [ITEM] with Harrison Ford?
Yes. It is my favorite of his. He is a medical doctor whose wife gets murdered. He is blamed for it and is on death row. He escapes and tries to figure out who murdered his wife. Tommy Lee Jones is the FBI agent after him.
You should watch it sometime!
Have you seen [ITEM] with Mel Gibson?
It's a good watch. Mel Gibson does not want to get involved in the Revolutionary war, but ends up getting very involved since things happen to his family. It's a very good movie too.
It's really good. He is very good in that movie.
I hope you get to watch those sometime! Have a good night!

Have you seen [ITEM] or [ITEM] ?
Both are good. They can be a little inappropriate, but very funny!
Have you ever watched [ITEM] ? It's more comedy than horror, I promise ;)

Hi!
Can I recommend movies for you in a certain genre?
Or do you have any favorites you'd like to tell me?
Or if you'd like to list any favorites, feel free
My favorite comedy ever is [ITEM]
It stars Joe Pesci, from [ITEM] (also another great flick)
Alright, let me see what else I can think of
Have you had a chance to catch [ITEM] ?

:)
I also loved [ITEM] and the movies that followed
Glad I could help, I hope you have a great weekend!
Well, to each their own ;) take care!
you too!
I'm doing well, thank you! How are you?
I've been into Shakespeare lately for romance. How about [ITEM]
It's got the original dialogue (which can be hard to wade through), but the setting is an interesting take on the story.
Okay then, how about [ITEM] ?
It's Joss Whedon's take on the story.
He filmed it at his house and brought in a lot of his regulars, but it was really good.
The only thing I didn't like was the costuming and the black and white presentation made character identification confusing in the beginning.
Otherwise, it's really good. :)
I LOVED [ITEM] . It's Owen Wilson going through 1920's Paris, mingling with famous artists all while dealing with the demands of his 21st Century girlfriend.
If you don't mind Kevin Smith, I recommend [ITEM] .
Sorry I couldn't offer more.
Any musicals you can recommend to me?
[ITEM] has been on my list for a few years now.
I saw a bit of it on YouTube. I loved how they weaved contemporary songs into classic French cabaret.
Thank you for the recommendation!
You too. Happy watching!
Hey, how are you tonight?
What genre of movie are you interested in watching?
That is a cute movie. Have you seen [ITEM]
A newer one I also love is [ITEM]

Or [ITEM]
No problem, hope you enjoy
Hi there, how are you doing today&gt;
Well, I personally like all of the [ITEM] movies, have you seen those?
There is a movie that may be more comedy than true Sci Fi but if you are a Sci fi fan you may want to check out [ITEM] !
You also can't go wrong with good ole fashioned [ITEM]
Have a great day!

[ITEM] was kind of freaky

I'm wonderful.
A great family film to watch is [ITEM] with Richard Dreyfuss it's an amazing film.

Hello.
Then you must check out [ITEM] or [ITEM] if you haven't already.
First of all there is no gore which is a huge plus. They are about hauntings and Ed and Lorraine Warren and some of the people they have helped.
They are 2 of my favorites! I am not a huge fan of gory horror movies so they were perfect and I enjoyed both.
Another non-gory movie is [ITEM] which is not gory but is a horror/thriller.
The Omen is a freaky freaky movie.
It's a very good one alien abduction related. But a very good watch!
Happy to help. Have a great night.

it is for everyone

Hello! What kind of movie are you looking for?
ooh, I'll be completely honest, I'm not a great expert on romantic movies. I like [ITEM]
and [ITEM] ... I guess romcoms are fun for me
Heath Ledger? Yeah, he was so good. Made [ITEM] .
[ITEM] was one which I disliked... one of the earlier representations of a gay relationship and they made the whole thing about sex instead of love. Anne Hathaway is amazing though
Yes! Dark Knight was awesome! Saw that on release day
Hi what kinds of movies do you enjoy?
Those are both cute.
What about [ITEM] ?
Very woman heavy
What about [ITEM] ?
hmm
[ITEM] is good
you too, bye
hello!

you can actually wait for [ITEM] car
which is about to release .....!
that is actually a good movie...!
Why don't you try that?
[ITEM] a good movie
[ITEM]
?
yess! even i do watch kids movie....
thank you!
bye!
Hey
What kind of film can I help you find today?
[ITEM] is kinda cute and great for kids
[ITEM] and [ITEM] went over well with my nephew when I took him to see them
My nephew goes around imitating the farting water buffalo, lol
I know right
Did you ever take them to see [ITEM] it's kind of different but a good story
It has a little action, and a slightly scary guy, but overall my nephew who's nine didn't think it was scary so, your call
It's actually based on a Japenese Folk legend that they tell their kids as a bedtime story, from what I understand
*Japanese
Because it's Japanese they do have the obligatory &quot;big fight scene&quot; at the end with the samurai swords and what not what I honestly did not think it was scary
Not a bad idea, I think it is definitely more geared toward boys but a girl would like it too if she has any interest in talking monkeys or oragami
Well I gotta go, enjoy the movies

I hope it's good. Most of the time movies made from books aren't the greatest. Did you see [ITEM] ?

It does. A movie I always watch when I can't find something else is [ITEM] it is a fantastic silly movie.
I saw the new [ITEM] a few weeks ago. It was pretty good. Today my children's made me sit through [ITEM]
I liked [ITEM] for what it was. [ITEM] is great it is far better than the other recent Disney movies, however 100 plus times on a movie is my limit.
I suppose there are far worse things to complain of. Have you seen [ITEM] It was one of my favorite movies a couple years ago.
It's by M. Night Shamalan, and not super suspenseful, but I loved the story.

Sci fi is a good choice! I would recommend [ITEM] it's packed with sci-fi action!
I would also recommend [ITEM] it was pretty popular at the box office and many people enjoy it!
Yea sure! Will Smith is an amazing actor! Have you seen [ITEM] it is the one he made with his son Jaden.
He doesn't really make sci-fi movies more action packed.
[ITEM] is another one that could easily be considered sci fi though.
I hope I was able to help you find a good movie you have a great day!

[ITEM] looks good too
Not comedies, lol. I am a historical buff.
[ITEM] is a good one, my daughter enjoyed it.

[ITEM] was a great movie if you haven't seen it.
It stars Micheal Cera.
Did you see [ITEM] ? Also another great one. It has video game elements woven throughout.
[ITEM] is a classic with great reviews.
I have. It stars Jim Carry and it has a few great twists.
The message would be lost on a child I think.
It is more suited towards adults due to it's serious nature
Any of the Disney classics such as [ITEM] or [ITEM] would be a great choice.
Glad to help. Have a nice day!

I havent seen the new [ITEM] yet but [ITEM] builds a really cool futureistic world
Its got bounty hunters and reincarnation elements
The special effects are incredible for Netflix show
Again Im a little more than half way through and its very inticate
Definitely one you have to pay attention to because there is so much going on.
Possibly the older [ITEM]
The whole vigilante theme
They both are about a man looking into a crime then going off on their own agenda because things keep unraveling into deeper issues
Also check out [ITEM]

Good morning! What sort of movie can I help you find today?
That was a great movie!
I think [ITEM] has a lot of similarities and will keep you guessing!
Also [ITEM] is a quite uniquely done movie in the same style.
I always like seeing new faces. It keeps things fresh.
Well basically it's about a home invasion and taking a family hostage.
It gets to become very thoughtful with a whole criticism of violence in media.
It's definitely worth checking out!
No I haven't seen that one yet... Looks very interesting
It reminds me of [ITEM] or [ITEM] Both great movies!
Thanks! You too!
Hello, can I recommend a movie for you?
[ITEM] [ITEM] [ITEM] and [ITEM] are some of the best comedy movies I have seen.

It's about a mob guy (joe pesci) who has a duffel bag with 8 heads in it, and it gets switched with an ordinary guys bag at the airport. The guy who gets the mob guys bag ends up with it while on vacation in mexico...It's laugh out loud funny!

I haven't seen it yet, but everyone I know says [ITEM] is super good.
Really?
I can't wait. I might see it this weekend!
huge screen big speakers can make a difference
another older film but it was very good was [ITEM] with Tom Hanks
stranded on a tropical island trying to survive.
It's pretty much Tom Hanks in the film so if you don't like him, don't watch it!

Hey!
I would start off with [ITEM] It's a great thrilling horror!
Another lesser known movie that I liked a lot is [ITEM]
Or at least I think these are lesser known, I'm not super up to date on what is popular, just what I've seen and liked.
Another great one, or rather series, is [ITEM] [ITEM] and [ITEM]
Very intense, and very scary, to me at least!
Have you seen any of those yet by chance?
Well I would highly recommend them all. They're all a bit different. [ITEM] is a bit more real life than the rest. [ITEM] is a bit supernatural, and hard to describe. [ITEM] and the rest are very intense as I said before, and also hard to describe!
I hope that you enjoy some of them, if not all!
Thanks for chatting!

Hello! What kind of movies do you like?

[ITEM] Is one of my favorites from the last few years. Have you seen it?
So, this one was pretty polarizing, but I thought the story and animation was super underrated - Did you see [ITEM] ?
It was really cute, yeah
Do you like older animation, too? [ITEM] is really fun.
Yes - That's one of my favorite Pixar films. Such a creative concept.
I haven't seen that one. It has fairies in it, right?
Nice

Ah - I thought maybe it was pretty similar to [ITEM]
Ok

WHat kind of movie are you looking for
Maybe check out some of the classics since you know a lot of new movies. Two of my favorite older comedies are [ITEM] and [ITEM]
Blazing Saddles is about a black sherrif coming to an old west town, it's a dark comedy by Mel Brooks who also directed movies like [ITEM] and [ITEM] Airplane! is just that, about an airplane, it's an over the top slapstick comedy that was ahead of its time.
Have you seen any Mel Brooks movies? He's considered the godfather of comedy.
You should! He's hilarious, and makes cameos in all of his movies.
Sounds good goodbye!

Hello.
Is there a specific genre you are interested in?
It's all good. I'm sure we all have things that catch our attention. What do you normally like to watch?
Those are both great movies. Have you ever seen [ITEM] ? I believe it is stephen King as well. No I don't imagine a 2 year old would enjoy such movies. They might have nightmares.
You probably know most of the Stephen King movies. Have you seen [ITEM] ? It's a thriller with a great deal of psychological aspects.
Awesome.
Hello. Merry Xmas.
[ITEM] was really good.
I liked [ITEM] a lot, the one with Jodie Foster.
They're both rated very high on IMDB
*highly

[ITEM] is about an award winning horse.
Could you give me an idea of a movie you do enjoy?

Great movie!
Goodbye
Hello
How about [ITEM] ?
[ITEM] Is also great.
Do you like Will Farrell?
I liked [ITEM]
That's a good one.
[ITEM] was good too.
[ITEM] also starred Kevin Hart
[ITEM] was worth watching, but not as good as the original
Alright. Take care.
hi how are you
hi how are you
have you seen [ITEM]
[ITEM] was good
[ITEM] is another fantastic film
bye have a great day
Hi how can I help you find a movie
Have you seen [ITEM]
or [ITEM]
What sort of Comedy do you usually like?
Then you will definitely like [ITEM]
You might not like that one as much if you're more into female led comedies
For that I would recommend [ITEM]
All of your examples were Female leads
You could also check out [ITEM]
Sure. What are you looking for?
Okay. Have you seen [ITEM] ?
If you liked the original, you will love the new one.
Also, [ITEM] Mummy was good
It's more action than horror thought
[ITEM] is good. a little more fantasy than horror but it has werewolves and vampires
I didn't too much care for [ITEM] but the rest of the franchise is decent
Because its a prequel and doesn't deal with the primary timeline from the first film
The best of the franchise in my opinion is [ITEM] it explains more of the backstory of the blood fued between the two races
hey! what a new movie coming out you would suggest
i want to see [ITEM]
how about [ITEM]
how about [ITEM] ?
thats a good one
have you seen [ITEM]

There's a new movie that is also scifi [ITEM]
It's got Hugh Jackman in it
you're welcome
bye
Hello. Looking for a good movie?
Have you seen [ITEM] ? I feel that was pretty different for a horror film.
Or how about [ITEM] ? That one scared me in the 90's
great psychological thriller with Dustin Hoffman. They find a spaceship on the ocean floor and it messes with their minds.
Noone can tell what/who to trust.
Kind of reminds me of [ITEM]
Definitely check it out. Another one from that time is [ITEM]
Another psychological thriller
Not from what I remember. More that the spaceships are almost like living beings.
Dont want to spoil too much for you.
You are welcome. Have a good one.

Nine intertwined stories examine the complexities of the one emotion that connects us all: love. Among the characters explored are David (Hugh Grant), the handsome newly elected British prime minister who falls for a young junior staffer (Martine McCutcheon), Sarah (Laura Linney), a graphic designer whose devotion to her mentally ill brother complicates her love life, and Harry (Alan Rickman), a married man tempted by his attractive new secretary.
It is great.
You will not be disappointed.

I watch mostly foreign films in the movie theaters
Well I saw 2 very good foreign films and then will suggest a couple films you might find on cable/dvd/netflix etc
[ITEM] just won an academy award
From Chile won best foreign language film so if you speak spanish or can read subtitles, it's a good film
I thought it was very moving
yes, [ITEM] from Russia.
Not what you would call a feel good film but very absorbing and heartfelt.
subtitles as well.
Ok, so now some US films on cable, you might have seen but if not are good
[ITEM] ? it's really good but it's not a happy fantasy kinda film.
Have you seen [ITEM] ?
with Mark Wahlberg?

hello
The only one that comes to mind that I've seen is [ITEM] that I saw when I was younger. It was pretty terrifying but also exhilarating.
What's your favorite comedy movie?
I have not seen that, what is it about?
Sounds like a good suggestion. I should check it out sometime.
Can't say I have but if you like slapstick humor the movie [ITEM] is a good bet in my opinion.
Ah yes, that was pretty funny, it's been awhile since I've seen that one. If you like that I would suggest [ITEM] It is a parody about rock n roll.
Ah, That's a tough one, I'll have to think for a second. There has been so many.
What about you? while i'm thinking...
Have not seen that but I have heard good things about that movie. Good suggestion.
I think mine is [ITEM]
Yes it is!
I'd say so. Good chat. Have a lovely day.
Hi, can I help you find a movie?
I love documentaries! Is something along the line of a Michael Moore film something you might be open to?
one film Michael Moore did was called [ITEM] it's about how even people with medical insurance arent covered for medical care by many insurance companies.
The other newer one of his is called [ITEM]
it's based on the premise that if you invade a country and win you as winner get to take something from them, so in France we take away their school lunch program where children are fed good meals on real plates and taught about good food.
vs. in the US where kids are fed variants of prison chow.
so he goes around the world showing how other nations do things. It
is pretty eye opening.
[ITEM] is about fracking and how it's potentially destroying a good deal of our water supply
especially the scene when they can light their water on fire!
ok, hope you like whatever you choose to watch!
bye
no problem . [ITEM]
it's about corporate farming
if nothing else [ITEM] encourages us to be aware about choices what we put in our mouths. It was stunning look at food

Hi. What are you here for?
The last very good movie I saw was [ITEM] It was very heartfelt and funny. I also saw [ITEM] which was action packed, and [ITEM]
I also rewatched [ITEM] and it was just as funny as I remembered.
I think [ITEM] felt more like a classic coming of age movie. There weren't any fancy effects, and it was simple, but that's why I liked it. It really stood out among the current movies that all have CGI or overdone plots.
It went back to basics, which was really refreshing.
I hope I suggested some things you can watch.
I haven't seen that, I'll check it out.
You too!
Hi! What type of movies are you looking for?
I love [ITEM] for forgetting about a bad day.
Or if you are looking for something funny [ITEM] is pretty good.
[ITEM] is kind of a combination of the two, it is funny and heartfelt in some parts.
Ah. How about [ITEM] ? That is my absolute favorite movie.
It is a fantasy movie about a young man who travels to a new land and finds a falling star. It has witches, ghosts and general comedy throughout the movie. It is just a silly movie that is full of heart. It is based on a Neil Gaiman book.
Hi
Can I help you find a movie to watch?
Happy to help!
[ITEM] is a classic
[ITEM] is another great one
[ITEM] would work too

Out of the Furnace is a 2013 American thriller film, directed by Scott Cooper, from a screenplay written by Cooper and Brad Ingelsby. Produced by Ridley Scott and Leonardo DiCaprio, the film stars Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, and Sam Shepard.
The film is about a Pennsylvania steel mill worker Russell Baze (Bale) and his Iraq war veteran brother Rodney (Affleck), who cannot adjust to civilian life. While Rodney makes some money doing bareknuckle fights for bar owner and small-time criminal John Petty (Dafoe), who runs illegal gambling operations, Rodney becomes so indebted due to his own gambling losses that he begs Petty to let him do a big money fight.

Did you have anything special in mind?
I loved [ITEM]
I have not seen [ITEM] Maybe I would give it a try.
Let me brainstorm a bit.
What about [ITEM]
Sadly I never had dogs because I grew up in an apartment.
I haven't seen it myself, but my friend loves it. She says it focuses on what goes into the mind of a dog. How they can be human like.
There's no violence, it's more heart warming in nature.
If you like something funnier, what about [ITEM]
It's great, especially if you like soccer.
Oh, that really sad, I was not aware of that.
I seen that. It's fun.
Would you like another recommendation?
Glad to be of service. Have a great evening.
Hi! What type of movie can I help you find tonight?
[ITEM] is a great option as is [ITEM] They both make me feel good.
Have you seen the new version [ITEM]
[ITEM] and [ITEM] have some similarities as well.
I think the original was better. But it's a pretty similar copy really.
I haven't seen that version. I've seen the Broadway play though. It was really enjoyable.
With musicals I generally prefer the live versions. The movie version can never capture the full experience.

[ITEM] , by far creeped me out the most. lol
and [ITEM] . I know they are old movies, but they do have great soundtracks.
Have you seen [ITEM] ?
Or [ITEM] even. I love that movie, it's intense.
It's about this guy who goes to check out room 1408, in a hotel, I believe. People are known to go in and never come out.
It's off limits, and he is the type of guy who goes around bringing logic to suspension and the paranormal.
Of course. Have a great night! :)
Hi how are you
what kind of movies are you interested in
I;m good thanks
[ITEM] was very good
have you seen [ITEM]

Hi well is it action that you like I assume?
or are you a major Jason Statham fan?
I really like Statham
lol ah okay well let me suggest a couple options
which you may or may not have seen
first Statham flicks
no I'm writing it out but had a lag sorry
[ITEM]
it's a little violent. so ....not for a romantic night!
lol
if you like him he's great, its just gritty
next is [ITEM]
AWESOME car chase with Mini's and Jason is in the film
if you love cars, action Jason it's a winner
and It's directed by [ITEM] director
yeah enjoy. I love all of them!
bye
Hi there!
Great, what type of movies do you like to watch with your family? Comedy? Family Fun?
[ITEM] was great! If you liked that, you'd definitely like something like [ITEM]
Or, if you want more fantasy, maybe [ITEM] is an older fantasy for children
Glad to hear! Another fantasy would be [ITEM] that's a good one as well
No problem! Have fun with them! Bye now!
hello
are you in need of a movie
good I hope I can help
may I ask a few questions before I list answers?
do you want only films that are limited in violent images or depictions?
some people are more sensitive to horror given recent events
There is a very horrifying Chinese film with subtitles but it does not involve the supernatural.
but really chilling.
oh let me see if its on the allowed list, one sec
LOL
[ITEM]
very disturbing. but no ghosts!
yes! fetuses to be exact
a variation on vampire cannibals. never could have been made in US
have you seen [ITEM] ?
It's in Spanish but there are English subtitles in the version I saw.
Without giving you the whole plot basically a young woman returns to her home which was an orphanage
she wants to help kids by opening a home for kids but...as things would have it in a horror film, something goes wrong
very atmospheric. creepy. good actually
Have you seen an Eli Roth films?
Ok so you've seen [ITEM]
brad pitt
ohhhhh okay very different from book but really still good film
it starts off fast and doesn't stop
very end of world but action well done
ok so, check out [ITEM] hippie do gooders go to Amazon to help natives.
things go wrong.
gory but interesting twists
ok as you can tell I like horror. are you Russian?
oh I wish there were more Russian films available to see in US
oh god no. I can barely speak English! lol
there is a movie called
oh hold on
[ITEM]
that I wanted to see.
Director Andrey Zvyaginstev
I love films that give a glimpse into other people's worlds different from day to day of my own
no. never heard of it. is it kinda a documentary?
about the native peoples of Siberia?
oh good thank you, I'll write it down. It might be streamed online
that sounds great. plus good camera work
is Omsk near where they had the meteor?
no the one that everyone caught on cell phone
I realize Siberia is a HUGE area. lol
I guess it sounded like an earthquake and broke lots of windows
I thought it was Siberia yeah a few years back
dont know. actually the news in the US isn't great with specifying locations
more about showing images on screen.
OH!
ok
that's been in the news in US, Kazakhstan.
ok so you aren't up in frozen tundra yak area
it's all related to corruption and Trump (aka Orange Hitler)
He apparently was involved in a conman type activity there too. He's a real moronic crook
He doesn't have the balls. He's a coward. And a crook. We have an election November. Can't wait.
well he sounds crazy so maybe he has to be removed! but in November are Congressional (like Parliment) elections and it's filled with GOP idiots.
we will see what happens here. it's very interesting in US right now.
it's okay! I have to go for now, but will be back later, maybe we meet again!
I will watch results.
you too! great chat! bye!

if you ever saw [ITEM] it's very similar

Also, I highly recommend [ITEM] but the beginning might be slightly too scary for the younger one...
If you don't mind Anime, I recommend [ITEM]
Anything Pixar is good, of course, [ITEM] , [ITEM] Inc
[ITEM] and [ITEM] so on, but your kids probably already seen those.
If you don't mind older films, I recommend the first [ITEM] didn't really see the sequels, but heard they're not as great, but still good for kids
You might like [ITEM] but not sure about the kids, it's rather serious in parts
[ITEM] is definitely one for any parent, it's about this woman who has to raise two kids alone who can turn into wolves at will.
You can find clips of it on Youtube..
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the suggestions! ::)

Hello, how are you?
Have you seen any good movies you would recommend lately?
I just watched [ITEM] and it was great. Which older films?
Those sounds like great movies. Are they mysteries? Have you watched [ITEM] ? Yes, Elf was good!!
Yes. It was also a good movie. In case you are in the Christmas spirit! I will check out the movies you have suggested. :)
Hmm, [ITEM] with Tim Allen is also a great movie.
I don't really know of any Christmas mystery movies or black and white Christmas movies, although I am sure there are some.
It is about some parent's who want to throw a good Christmas party that is tradition in their family when their daughter comes home from college for her Christmas break. And various things go wrong. It is a comedy.
He is a great actor. One more I would recommend is A Christmas Story. Very cute movie that my kids and I watch every year.
[ITEM] I mean
That would be awesome. Well, I have to run. I hope you have a great day!
Hi, there!

[ITEM] looked good, too.
Ooh, that's like the original horror film!
It's an Alfred Hitchcock film about some very strange goings on at the Bates Motel, including an owner who's a devoted mama's boy.
It's a great movie.
[ITEM] is pretty scary too.
Yeah, I agree. They scare me more haha. [ITEM] was pretty good too.
I had to watch [ITEM] for a class in college and the whole classroom was screaming at certain parts... it was hilarious. [ITEM] really freaked me out.
Yeah it's insane!
Oh really? That's crazy!
The Warrens are actually real, I know someone who knows the priest who blesses their &quot;artifacts&quot; room
Yeah, I think Lorraine is still alive? And ahh I know it's so creepy to think about
Me too. [ITEM] and [ITEM] are my favorites.
I know its so great. I love how gutsy and spunky she is!
Have you seen [ITEM]
Ok so it looks and soudns weird, but it's actually really good. It's about a boy who wants to learn more about his family and ancestors and travels to the land of the dead to interact with them. It's surprisingly touching and lovely. Also a tear jerker.
I've also heard really good things about [ITEM] , but I haven't seen it yet

Thrillers

Okay well [ITEM] is a drama/thriller with Kevin spacey about murder with crazy twists which is really good.
Also crime drama movies are [ITEM] ehjch is really good.
Jake gylenhal, Jose Pena, Anna Kendrick. [ITEM] is another crazy murder mystery with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.
It’s really good, the only annoying part was there was way too much cussing. But another great crime thriller is [ITEM] with Ashley Judd Morgan Freeman and Jim cavaziel
[ITEM] is another great murder movie
You’re welcome have a good day. Goodbye!

Not so bad, not so bad. What about you?
So tell me what's the oldest movie you can remember seeing
Wow that's a good one. What a creepshow!
Bette Davis in one of her last film roles
Oh!
If you liked that one...
Tell me you saw [ITEM]
Even CREEPIER
Oh wow.
You have a treat awaiting then.
That is WIlliam Holden and the silent film actress Gloria Swanson
She came out of retirement to play that role.
People hadn't seen her in decades.
that's why it blew people's minds.
that's why it blew people's minds.
She basically plays herself
Don't look it up. The ending is the twist.
It'll stay with you. Not horrifying, just breathtaking and ghastly.
if you have cable you can catch that on TMC every once in awhile. Maybe on-demand.
Directed by Billy WIlder. You will see why they had such high regard for him as a directot.
Little by little the story takes shape as things leak out.
Things that weren't important to know early on in the movie become plot twists. And when you think you have it figured out, NOPE.
You might also like [ITEM] which so many people insist is one of the top ten of all time. Hitchcock.
See that one on the biggest TV you can get in front of
I love Vincent Price.
[ITEM]
That one on Halloween.
One of the first 3D movies
in that amazing deep Kodakchrome color
Hope that'll get you started.
But I am sure you will love [ITEM]

Totally changed movies.

Oh me too, I don't know anyone who doesn't. lol
[ITEM] is supposed to be really funny
Any time! :)
Hello. What kind of movie are you looking to watch?
I really liked the [ITEM] movies. The first one was especially creepy.
The last horror movie I saw was [ITEM] . I hate clowns, but it wasn't too bad or scary.
Have you ever seen [ITEM] ?
That was is creepy.
Hi! What can I recommend for you today?
I don't blame you. I don't like horror movies.
I don't think I've seen that one. Have you seen [ITEM]
I like movies like [ITEM]

Hello!
What kind of movie are you looking for today?

Both really kept my attention.
That and [ITEM] were favorites of mine this year.
Great acting!
Have a great day.
Hello!
What kind of movies are you into?
Any specific genres you are into?
Have you seen [ITEM] ? A recent one, it was very good. Very gritty and captivating.
It is about a detective trying to find a local killer who leaves behind snowmen after he commits each murder.
It's a good one! How about [ITEM] Have you seen that one?
It's not that old, but I always thought it was a really good and intense movie.
Glad I could help out!
Hi
What can I help you find today?
Those are all great movies.
Be sure to check out [ITEM] when it hits theaters.
[ITEM] is great. Also, [ITEM] and [ITEM]
Hi there!
What kind of movie are you looking for?
Have you seen [ITEM] or [ITEM]
Or if super heroes aren't your thing, maybe [ITEM] .
If you like the super hero ones, how about [ITEM]
No problem, bye!
Sure thing. Have you seen [ITEM] ?
Good point. :)
What about [ITEM] with Jennifer Laawrence and Chris Pratt?
A guy (Pratt) is awakened prematurely on an interstellar space trip, and wakes up another passenger (Lawrence) for company. Meanwhile the ship is in danger of falling apart and they have to figure out why.
It is. But it's still an okay movie.
If that sounds too slow, try [ITEM] with Jake Gylenhal and Ryan Reynolds. It's a dark film about an alien life form from Mars.
In that case, also try [ITEM] . It's not a remake of the original, it's a prequel. It tells the story of what happened to the Norwegians before the dog shows up at the US camp
Nope. Entirelly different story.
Also, check out [ITEM] with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster. Very similar to Passengers but much darker and no romance.
Sure are. :)

The second one was also pretty funny

That's why I went and saw it!
Have you seen [ITEM] ?? They have [ITEM] coming out in June and I'm excited for it too!
Hello, how are you?
What can I help you with today?
those are both good, I could recommend [ITEM] or maybe even [ITEM] if you are looking for newer flicks
Or maybe even [ITEM] for something a bit older
Yes, it is a tale of a young person tracking down mysterious monsters.
If you are looking for non-stop action I would go with [ITEM]
In my opinion it is better than the original, are you needing any other suggestions?
Great, have a nice day
lol, I sure can.
Does time period matter? Or genre?
Then I would say start with 2 of my Tim Allen favorites, [ITEM] and [ITEM] .
Both very funny with strong messages about family.
As for classic films, I'd recommend [ITEM] . You can never gone wrong with that one.
I dunno, but the live musical versions of the Wiz and Grease were great so maybe this will be too.
If you ahve kids, a good animated movie would be [ITEM] . Tom Hanks does a voice over of the conductor.

It's really good. It's about a middle-aged man who loses his job because he doesn't have a degree. He decided to go back to college. The movie focuses on this writing class he takes from a female professor who is portrayed by Julia Roberts. There is a little romance, but it is a really good movie. I got a lot from it.
Have you seen [ITEM]

Hey there!
Sci fi buff? You've asked the right person, haha.
A person with great taste, I can recommend you last years [ITEM] , but you should definitely see the very first movie of it which was [ITEM]
Yes, they sure are, and if you're a big fan of getting to know the movie or appreciating the movie by your own speculations and analysis, I would recommend both.
But if you want something more casual but still Sci fi, [ITEM] is a movie I would recommend, although animated, space adventure with a bunch of bounty hunters is simply good.
Lol, go see all of them my friend, well that's it, hope you have a good one!
Hello!
How can I help you?
Great! I love [ITEM]
[ITEM] is very good too.
How about [ITEM]

Hi, how are you?

Have you seen [ITEM] ?
Fascinating film about two tech employees in the Bay area who happened to discover a fatal malware created by the US government and Israeli to insert this virus into the computers of the Iranian government nuclear program and to dismantle it. However, it can operate on its own and do what it does.
Pretty much film goes on to say this malware or virus is out there and can shut down the entire continent power grid.
It is worth the watch. This malware is out of the box and is worst than a nuclear missile in my own opinion.
I think Amazon should carry it.
Another film is [ITEM] by Mel Gibson and it is worth the time and money.
A great film to watch and be carried away from the busy life.
Another suggestion is [ITEM] which is about Winston Churchill I just finished watching. Amazing is all I can say.
I think the year is wrong it barely came out last year.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I am glad I can help.
Bye

Hello! How are you!?
So I heard you are interested in movies!
Let's start off with some genres that you like?
Sorry, I have not.
Hmm.... Let's see.
Sorry, Im looking at Netflix to see if I ca assist with finding you movies in that genre that I've enjoyed.
Yes I have seen that movie, and I rather disliked it. The movie [ITEM] was not all that attention grabbing.
I'm more interested in the horror genre, sci-fi, all that jazz!
Sorry about me taking too long to assist with finding a movie.
One moment please.
Have you ever seen [ITEM]
I enjoyed both the novel and the movie. I greatly recommend it for sci-fi lovers.
Aside from movies, a really good show in Netflix I'd recommend is Black Mirror.
Each episode is a different story and it focuses on the future of technology and how it could go wrong in the future.
Yeah, I really enjoyed it! The first season is alright but the 3rd and 4th season I really enjoyed
Each episode is different so there's variety in the show. It's definitely a show that makes you sit down and think for a while after watching.
Hope you enjoy! :)
Yes, I have! Funny story, I watched that movie during a thnderstorm with my sister at home and as seen as we finished it the power went out
Talk about scary, haha!
I didn't have a choice! Sadly...
Have you ever seen [ITEM]
Well, if you don't like horror. Japanese horror is even more scary
Nice talking to you. Have a great rest of your day!

There is also something like [ITEM] it has a lot of romance, but did make me cry several times.
A man writes letters to his wife, which she reads and follows to the instructions after he dies. In a way of grieving.
I would also say something like [ITEM]
It is very good.
There is also a lesser known movie called [ITEM] with a lot of drama.
A coming of age drama, involving a 13 year old.
Well, do you think that will get you started?

I'm here to help you find a movie or two. If that is what you would like.

For example [ITEM] was really good. It was a bit chilling but it left me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen.
[ITEM] ng is a great classic with Jack Nicholson. I don't think there is any movie that is any scarier.
No, The Mother is about a couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.
It gets pretty hairy at time because of jealousy
Sounds great. I'm glad you liked the recommendations. Goodbye

Hannibal was a great villian
Haven't seen those last two, though

The part where he feeds a guy his own brain is way more funny than scary, though
so goofy
Maybe I'm desensitized by stuff like GTA these days
Grand Theft Auto; very popular game series
If there is one, then it's only fan-made
Not off the top of my head. [ITEM] can be scary
but really it is just emotional
most powerful movie I've ever seen
I think Ebert said something similar

It's a film about hired assassins from various parts o the world.

It's a great one. [ITEM] was also a good thriller, but less about criminals.
I haven't seen that one myself,
There's a somewhat more obscure horror thriller called [ITEM] from Guillermo Del Toro. Have you seen it?
[ITEM] is a foreign mystery that you might like, if you can find a copy.

hmm i never heard of it haha
well, a lot of independant movies like [ITEM] are certainly unusual
Especially when it comes to a big star like Brad and an independant film
its almost like he never likes to play in sequels but will for [ITEM] part 2
ok i hope you enjoy them all
wow
yeah likewise! good night
Hello!
What type of movies do you like?
Have you seen [ITEM] ? It's a romantic comedy and certainly fantasy.
It's pretty epic. I also really like [ITEM] .
It's a romance. A man remodels and house and then rents it out. It turns out that the man and the new tenant exchange letters through time travel.
I also really liked [ITEM] .
I preferred the book on [ITEM] but it is still good. Have you seen [ITEM] ?
It was pretty good!
Have you seen [ITEM] ?
It is by M. Knight Sham (I can't remember how his name is spelled) I loved it.
You're welcome! Have a great night!
Hi! What kind of movies do you like?
How about [ITEM]
I haven't heard of that one.
The original [ITEM] was good
DOn't watch the sequels in my opinion.
If you like the new [ITEM] you should watch the old version [ITEM]
Of course, [ITEM] is a classic for a reason.
Any of these suggestions work for you?
Great! Have a nice morning!
Goodbye!
Hey there, what kind of movies are you into?
[ITEM] was great
[ITEM] was also cool
Those are two of my favorite movies!
I think you're all set!
Have a good day!
Hello there. What are you looking for tonight?
Like [ITEM] ?
Okay, so more of a thriller?
You can judge me but I think of [ITEM] as a classi.
About twenty years. Crazy I know.
I was young teen when all of those came out like [ITEM]
It wasn't as great but still gave me a few chills.
Have you seen [ITEM]
Or maybe [ITEM] ?
Oh, wow. Ahead of the game! OK. I haven't.
Is that a superhero movie?
There are a lot of Xmen. How about [ITEM] ?
I think a new one might be coming out
I haven't watched it, no. Maybe I should!
Do you need more suggestions?
Good haha. Have a good night.
Sure, what about [ITEM] ? I always enjoyed it.
It's about someone whose family doesn't know he is a spy.
And his worlds kind of colliding.
If thats not your thing you could always watch [ITEM] ?
Nope, a movie about retired action stars kind of.
But if you were looking superhero action you could go with [ITEM]
and you could always watch [ITEM]
Hey there! Im doing great! Hopefully you are as well!
What kind of movie should be on the menu today? Maybe a good action movie?
I always love a good action movie! One of my favorites of all time is Jean Claude Vann Damme's [ITEM] . It was such a cool martial arts action based movie
with him in them or another actor? Because [ITEM] was also pretty awesome.
Thank you! If you really want to see some awesome action sequences [ITEM] with Christian Bale is something special
Oh yes! I am a sucker for a good comic book movie. But perhaps if you want something a little darker you could watch [ITEM]
it's about a man who sells his soul to the devil and comes back with superpowers
definitely dark, but definitely a lot of action. and just a touch of humorous elements to it
haha. yeah! but that would be the only part. Think of [ITEM] but before it was a thing
How are you ?
What kind of movies do you like ?
Have you seen, [ITEM] , [ITEM] ?
I have not seen either
Yes indeed
those are classics
hope that answered your questions
have a nice night

It's with Denzel Washington and very good. It's about government corruption.
Yes, that was good too! You have a good night!
Hello!
What kind of movies are you interested in?
I do! [ITEM] was super good. It's a bit of a mystery or crime movie that keeps you hooked all the way through.
[ITEM] is another good choice. I loved the book and the movie as a kid. I watched it again recently and it was still just as good.
Yes! He is the lead character. His best role, in my opinion.

[ITEM] and [ITEM] are up for Oscars and are really great!
It's very good and has good drama, though it is based on true events.

It has Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Josh Hartnett. It's about a young guy who gets caught in the middle of a fight between two high level crime families.

Yeah, it's a horror movie in a David Fincher style, very mixed reviews, but it was great. What's a good movie you'd like a similar recommendation for?
You know, I haven't. It looked interesting when it popped up on Netflix, a good action movie they put out a little bit like that though is [ITEM] [ITEM] got some real bad reviews, so I passed.

First up is [ITEM]
This one is a collection of short films with dark Christmas themes. Krampus being one of them
There's also [ITEM] itself. It's good. My kids liked it. But it's just on the edge of scary/creepy. It doesn't do much to terrify you though
It is. Have you seen it?
There's also [ITEM] . It's a cheesy slasher flick with Santa as the killer.
My thoughts exactly
Last there's [ITEM] about a kid who goes on a homicidal rage dressed as Santa. Pretty decent

hello! What are you looking for today&gt;
that's a great one! I like [ITEM] a lot, but it has a heavy emphasis on music and Rebel Wilson is pretty annoying
[ITEM] is fantastic if you like the character of Deadpool, but to be honest if you aren't a fan already it probably isn't worth watching
it has a lot of very raunchy humor. Ryan Reynolds is great in pretty much anything though
[ITEM] is pretty funny, as long as you like Seth Rogan
I love Russell Brand, he was the best part of that movie! [ITEM] is worth watching just for the drug scene!
you're welcome, have a wonderful day :)
Great. How are you?

Hello!
How are you this evening?
Okay! Have you seen [ITEM] That is one that I really enjoyed. It had a good villan, good music, and it was funny.
I thought [ITEM] had some humor in it too. I really like the Aquaman character and also the Flash character. They were pretty funny.
What super hero movies do you like?
Those movies are really good. Christian Bale was my favorite Batman and I loved Tobey Macquire. He kind of looks like my brother-in-law.
I also like [ITEM] That was probably my favorite one.
It is. Well, I hope you get a chance to see those other two! Have a good night. Bye!
What type of movies do you usually like?
Can I assume that Rated R is okay? And that it is for a date in a theater?
Did you see [ITEM]
It won awards and got great reviews.
[ITEM] is opening.
Reviews were okay, but not great.
Virtual world future.
Save the Earth. full of adventure.
[ITEM] is still in theaters.
Another action flick, but a female is the main character.
It might appeal to both genders, since it is not just guys beating each other up.
Hopefully your date will like one of those choices.
Have fun!
Can I suggest one more? for next weekend go to [ITEM]
It comes out soon. I think
Bye.
Hello.
What kind of movies do you like?
Yes! Have you seen [ITEM] with Bill Murray? It's kind of older like that one. It's so good!
[ITEM] is another funny and family friendly one.
This one is kind of silly but I find it hilarious... it is [ITEM]
I always laugh so hard and it always brings me up when I'm feeling stressed.
It's so good. Night! Bye!
Hello!
Hmmmm, let me think...
The first thing that comes to mind is [ITEM] It's not really about horses, but the girl in the movie does ride horses during the movie
The move [ITEM] was also quite good, but it is aimed at a more mature audience
I can't think of any more movies about horses. What else does your daughter like?
A lesser known prince/princess movie that I really enjoyed was [ITEM]
[ITEM] is another great one that is often forgotten
I loved [ITEM] ! I haven't yet seen [ITEM] but I heard it was very good as well

Hi.
Let me think.
I liked [ITEM] .
I like the super hero ones like [ITEM] .
It's about time travel and about a crime organization that uses it to do illegal stuff.
I saw [ITEM] .
That should be the Age of Ultron.
I think it's kind of like it but more with time travel and not so much teleporting.
[ITEM] was dark.
A lot different from the others.
No.
Ok, it's got bruce willis.

Hello
I would like to recommend the movie [ITEM] It is a really fun movie with a great soundtrack.
Good thanks how are you?
You have good taste!
Yeah, I'm trying to think. This one isn't like [ITEM] but have you seen [ITEM] ? I just recently watched it and it is very funny.
People have compared [ITEM] to [ITEM] but I feel like [ITEM] is more approachable
Ah, I haven't seen that version. I prefer the old Rankin Bass [ITEM] feels more true to the book
No worries, I think the thing that changed is that newer movies aren't willing to take as many chance
Or at least the bigger studios
Pixar takes chances, and makes' good movies.
Always easier to use something existing than to try original thought
Nice talking to you, have a great day

[ITEM]
yes she was good
In 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), legendary manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, defies major league baseball's notorious color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team. The heroic act puts both Rickey and Robinson in the firing line of the public, the press and other players. Facing open racism from all sides, Robinson demonstrates true courage and admirable restraint by not reacting in kind and lets his undeniable talent silence the critics for him.

Excellent. One of the better recent horror movies is [ITEM]
It's a revenge horror movie where a father avenges the death of his son by hunting the people who killed him.
I also saw [ITEM] and didn't find it scary. It was still a good movie though.
Another movie you could try is [ITEM] it's pretty recent and I enjoyed it. Good reviews too.
The scariest movie I have ever seen probably isn't very scary but has to do with how old I was when I saw it. I'd say it was [ITEM] . I was young when I saw it so it was quite a fright.
I have never seen [ITEM] but I might look into it, thanks!

There is talk of a spin off from that series soon. The Crooked Man
Well, do you like monsters or psychos?
You can't go wrong with a classic like [ITEM] Jack was pretty monstrous in it!
Oh, I suppose [ITEM] would count as both too.
I prefer the television version still, but mainly because I love Tim Curry.
Of course, if you want a 'scary movie' that is good for a laugh, try [ITEM] . It is just silly bad lol
Take care

I have not yet seen that one!

Sounds really good! Have you seen [ITEM] ?
Yeah! It is really scary! I didnt like it very much because of that
I have not yet seen it, either! I will make sure to watch that one too .

Thank you, Goodbye!
hello!
what kind of movie are you looking for tonight?

Have you seen [ITEM] ?
Hitchcock is one of my favorite filmmakers!
I think it's Audrey Hepburn's best work, but it's very underrated
Awesome! I'm glad you like them!
Have a great night! :)
Hello
Have you seen the movie [ITEM] ?
I'm good!
How are you?
It's about the FCC and their unethical ratings
That movie is great!
I love documentaries.
[ITEM] is really good too, just sad.
That's one I still need to see.
[ITEM] is really good.
Thanks for the convo!
Hey can I help you find a movie?
Hey you seen [ITEM]
[ITEM] was pretty good tho for something more similar.
Also [ITEM] is a classic movie that had a nice plot
I watched [ITEM] recently it's more of a professional race movie but it was really good.
[ITEM] I think is one of the movies that started the whole street race genre as well.
Great I think you will enjoy it.
Bye
Hello
What kind of movies do you like?
I haven't seen that one yet.
Have you seen [ITEM] I thought that was very good.
Did you see [ITEM] ? I enjoyed that a lot.
I saw that as well and thought it was pretty good.
You should check out [ITEM] I think you will like that one.
No all the others are horror.
It's a good weekend for watching movies where I am.
We are going to have rain, so it will be perfect. In NJ.
I hope you have a good night!
Hello there! What kind of movies are your favorites?
Well, [ITEM] is a great one
Jeffrey Hunter starred.
and the content is OK for kids I think.
The score was Oscar-winning.
Another I liked was [ITEM] which has it's great moments.
That one has the amazing Noah's Ark depiction with funny animals.
Dino DeLaurentis was cinematographer. Directed by John Huston.
He even played Noah in it
I just saw it on Turner Classic Movies because Pesach is this week and Easter was Sunday
All the best Bible epics happened in the 50s and 60s. Hollywood wouldn't touch the subject again until the 1980a
and those 80s movies aren't intended for kids.
Probably best to focus on the old ones.
Did you ever see [ITEM]
It's more adult, but not too horrible. It does depict the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem.
[ITEM] surely does
But for this week, [ITEM] is the go-to movie.
If the kids can focus for four hours
Hope you like the suggestions.
Bye now!
Oooh horror movies! Are you looking at gory, classic, suspense?
Have you seen [ITEM] ?
Five interwoven stories that occur on Halloween: An everyday high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer; a college virgin might have just met the guy for her; a group of teenagers pull a mean prank; a woman who loathes the night has to contend with her holiday-obsessed husband; and a mean old man meets his match with a demonic, supernatural trick-or-treater.
Its really unique

[ITEM] is a recent animated animal movie.
Alternatively, [ITEM] and [ITEM] are both charming.

Well, if you truly look at Disney movies, most have a dark scene in them. [ITEM] for example involves a witch stealing the main character's voice and dooming the king.
My favorite movie involves animals actually. [ITEM]
[ITEM] had many as well. I believe Disney is trying to prepare children for harsh realities. Though, it does surprise many.

Hello
Are you there?
Well how about the new [ITEM] movie?
I also want to see [ITEM] that is coming up
However most action movies are just remakes
[ITEM] was a remake of a comic book
I am a fan of [ITEM]
Well then that is what I have for you!
Have a good evening.
Hi.
As far as recent movies, I enjoyed [ITEM] a lot more than I thought I would.
It's got a soundtrack reminiscent of 80s Sci-Fi films and the comedy is perfectly spread out through the film. Also, it's got Jeff Goldblum doing what he does best.
I think it's the best of the bunch. The only prerequisite viewing (if any) would be the second Thor, I think.
I also recently saw [ITEM] It's Christina Ricci in a comedy set at a Rennaissance Faire. The jokes are kind of raunchy, but I still enjoyed it.
That's one I wanted to see last year, but I didn't find the time for it.
Did you see [ITEM] ?
It's a Judd Apatow produced comedy about a man who's trying to reconcile his family's traditional values in marriage and his interest in a woman whom his family wouldn't consider...who also has a serious illness.
No problem. I hope you enjoy it! Take care!
HI
I heard you might be looking for a movie. What type of movies do you like?

It has a similar feel to it I think.
[ITEM] Is like that too.

Hey, hey! What type of movies can I help you find?
Romantic comedies? Hmm... not exactly my forte, but I think I can come up with some
Have you seen [ITEM] ? That might fit the bill.
Or maybe [ITEM] ? Seen that and it's really good!
You can also try [ITEM] with Will Smith, another good one
Personally, I wasn't a big fan of [ITEM] but others have enjoyed it.
BTW.. not actually seen [ITEM] just fyi

I'd try [ITEM]

How about [ITEM] ? That's a classic at this point
Maybe you haven't seen it yet
Yeah it wasn't the greatest movie but the genre isn't all too common so beggars can't be choosers
Yeah I agree it is a pretty entertaining genre to watch. Have you seen [ITEM] though?
Gotcha, yeah, it worth a try hah.
How about [ITEM] ? I really like that one
One of my favorites, highly recommend it. I love the scenery of the movie also
hmm
I'm not sure but I don't think so. You could probably rent it from some other service
Well however you find it, you won't be disappointed for putting the effort in finding it!
It's a little different but check out [ITEM]
It's based on a true story apparently
Have you seen it?
Okay sure, well I think it's worth watching, it might not be as good as the other suggestions but if like that sort of genre you'll probably enjoy it
Anyhow I think I'm out of ideas! So I hope you enjoy some of those

If you're into superheros [ITEM] and [ITEM] are pretty good as well.
[ITEM] is okay, but Ragnarok is definitely better.
If you decide to see the third film, make sure to see the second first so you'll understand what's going on.

But if you definitely want something in theaters, try [ITEM] . It's got Idris Elba and Kate Winslet and is very good.
Sort of. It's about two strangers who find themselves stranded on a mountain after their plane crashes. A romance builds from their struggles.
Like wise.

Hi there. What sorts of movies are you looking for today?
Hmmm.....does genre or time period matter?
Okay, I'm not sure what you would consider a tear jerker, but I'll give a few that got me in the feels, lol.
There's [ITEM] from Disney Pixar. It's animated but the story hits home in a lot of ways.
Then there's [ITEM] with Will Smith and Helen Mirren.
Also, though it's not a &quot;tear jerer&quot; per se, the ending did make me cry a bit. [ITEM] with Anton Yelnich. I guess it's even more so difficult to watch knowing he's passed since then.
Hmm.... let me see.....
Hae you ever seen [ITEM] ?
It's about an almost-blind Czech immigrant whose only way of escaping the horrors of a murder trial are by starring in her own musicals.
Gets me everytime.

Hi what kind of movie are you looking for?
Cool have you watched [ITEM] . It is with Noah Wyle?
I can also recommend [ITEM] which is similar to like the [ITEM]
You should also read the book version by Dan brown.
Yes I did. Every year I watch all of the nominated movies.
How abou [ITEM] which is based on a painting.
It is also a book as well.
Does time period matter?
Great! Most of what I have are comedies. [ITEM] is a good one. But if you want something a little more serious, try [ITEM] . Shemar Moore and Morris Chestnut are in that one.
There's also [ITEM] featuring Taye Diggs and Omar Epps. It's similar to [ITEM]
Another good one is [ITEM] . It's about Ralph &quot;Petey&quot; Greene, the radio talkshow host from the 60s. Don Cheadle is in that one.
There are plenty, but I would recommend [ITEM] (with Welsey Snipes) and [ITEM] . It's like an action/espionage film.
No problem. I hope you enjoy the movies!
Hey there! What kind of films are you looking for today?
Sure! I've seen a few good movies recently - [ITEM] and [ITEM] were both very good. But if you are looking for something more based in reality, [ITEM] was an amusing movie!!

It's not for everyone. We all have different tastes.

An even better film would be [ITEM] with Jodie Foster
[ITEM] with Faye Dunaway is a great film, you should watch that.

Yes, that's the one! It was really intriguing
It's about the food that we eat and basically how unhealthy it is. Didn't make me eat healthier but was still interesting

I haven't actually seen [ITEM] but I hear it's excellent. My nieces won't stop singing the songs.
Oh, okay, wasn't sure if there was someone out there who also would admit to liking [ITEM] My kid loves it!
I really want to see the new [ITEM] but I haven't seen the first one yet [ITEM] That one is out on Netflix, I think.
Sounds like a plan! You too!
What kind of movies are you looking for?
Ok I can help with that!
[ITEM] is a comedy that was so popular, it resulted in a sequel
and then a trilogy
[ITEM] was a remake, but a good one at that.
[ITEM] is more of a mixed comedy, like the [ITEM] franchise
I believe the same people made [ITEM]

Hi! Can I recommend a movie for you today?
What a good genre. Have you seen [ITEM] It's a bit of a cult-classic.
[ITEM] might also be of interest, it's been described as a horror movie &quot;turned up to 11.&quot; I think it's Japanese, but it's themes are very adult.
Then of course there are classics like [ITEM] or the new [ITEM] but I'm sure you've seen them!
Absolutely, have a good night!
Hello
What sort of movies are you looking to find?
Absolutely.
If you like older flicks, you could check out [ITEM] or [ITEM]
Some good newer ones would be [ITEM] and [ITEM]
[ITEM] is about two rednecks who get caught in some wild antics in the woods.
The other one is about a guy whose girlfriend becomes ill and their struggles.
Of the two, I would say [ITEM] is the better choice
Yep, enjoy!

What kind of movies do you like?
How about [ITEM] or [ITEM]
Have you seen [ITEM]
or [ITEM]
What about [ITEM]
No, problem
yes it is
bye
How about some comedy?
I love a good laugh.
haven't seen [ITEM] but heard it is good.
Yeah, I heard there were a bunch like a trilogy.
I like Bradley cooper.
These are all good suggestions. Haven't seen any of them but will maybe check out this weekend.
Good chat.
Good evening!
I've got a few in mind.
If you like Joss Whedon and Shakespeare, check out [ITEM] . It's a modern retelling of the play (maintaining Elizabethan language) starring a lot of Mr. Whedon veterans.
Mr. Whedon's*
Sorry, my spelling is off tonight.
I also enjoy Kevin Smith and the one film that truly brought him to prominence was [ITEM] . It diverts from the traditional ending, but it still has a great message.
It's not my favorite by him, but it's one of his best from a technical and artist perspective.
Now I have the music stuck in my head...
It's all good though.
I've got a quirky romantic comedy if you're interested. [ITEM] . The jokes can get raunchy, but it's a cool like flick where Christina Ricci stretches her acting chops in a Renaissance faire.
No problem. Now to try and get some catchy songs out of my head. :)

Watch [ITEM] with Angelina Jolie.
After that, watch [ITEM]
Both have great female roles.
Great, bye now!
hello
Hmmmm do you like adult comedies or the comedies more for teenage boys?
I just watched [ITEM] and didn't think I'd like it and ended up loving it
Have you seen the sequel, [ITEM] ?
I haven't yet
Oh that's too bad. Sometimes they should just leave well enough alone.
Some Will Ferrell films I thought were funny were [ITEM] which I'm sure you've seen.
OMG
it's funny. It's different than something like [ITEM] which is good too
but only if you're in a goofy mood.
Yeah anyone else as lead it might not work but if you love him you'll suffer through the couple scenes that don't work.
you too, enjoy the funny ness!

Good evening!
My girlfriend recently got me into John Hughs films. [ITEM] was surprising good.
She also showed me [ITEM] with Stanley Tucci as Puck. I admit haven't seen too many adaptations of it, but I still really enjoyed it (the other ones were kind of bad though).
If you're into indie, I'd also recommend [ITEM] . It's a pretty &quot;by-the-books&quot; rom-com (woman is in a rut and embraces her inner fun to find love and happiness), but it's still a decently solid film by Nia Vardolous (writer and star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding).
I haven't seen [ITEM] , but I've heard good things about it.
No problem! Have a great night and happy watching!

I tend to find them more horrifying
yes.

the visuals are some of the best most horrifying vampires I've ever seen

hello! what types of movies are you looking for?
Oh the [ITEM] is a great movie!!
There is a youtube movie called [ITEM] that I really enjoyed. It's about a new thing in the schools in Texas where if kids don't pass this exam, they &quot;die&quot; however they really don't, they just get sent underground. its to thin out the &quot;non-smart kids&quot;
It was. Because the whole time I was thinking, &quot;what parent can let their kid die like that?&quot; and they actually don't die. lol
So i'm not sure if you're into gore type movies, but [ITEM] is actually set in 2040 and [ITEM] is set in 2023
I enjoyed [ITEM] more than the others. they are coming out with a new one this summer that is a prequel to all the [ITEM] movies

Do you want films similar to the drama itself or about 9/11?
A good 9/11 film is [ITEM] with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle
It's very good. As serious and dramatic as [ITEM] .
There's also [ITEM] with Nicholas Cage.
Not sure how you feel about him as an actor though, lol
Another of my favorites is [ITEM] it's more about one of the planes that fell that day, not necessarily the tower strikes themselves.
Another good film is [ITEM] . It's about a flight attendant that has to fly with a muslim post 9/11. It starts slow but the tension and drama build throughout the film. :)
Anytime! Have a Merry Christmas!

You might find it both exciting and educational.

I know [ITEM] is a very action filled American war film, told from an American perspective. I was fascinated!

Well, I'm pretty good with recommendations! What kind of genre are you feeling today?
[ITEM] isn't very well known, and it's in a different language, but it's honestly a GREAT movie! [ITEM] is a good sci-fi movie too!
I don't think so actually,Sigourney Weaver is though
[ITEM] is a good alien type movie, it's about campers that are being hunted by an alien bear type thing. Definitely not for children though.
Also, [ITEM] is more of a realistic alien movie. It's hard to follow at first and may seem confusing, but it explains it all at the end. Worth looking at!

Natural Born Killers, I mean, that is both action packed and arty.
Have you seen [ITEM]
It's realy good, it's perhaps not as action packed as you were thinking.
There's also [ITEM] which is well made and pretty intense.
Ok, great. I am glad I could help

Hello there!
Hello there!
I heard about the movie [ITEM] and wondered if you heard if it was any good?
good! thank you
Ahh.. I loved [ITEM]
Right.
I like [ITEM] .. it isn't for everyone though
Seth Rogen movies are usually pretty funny.. [ITEM] is a good example
Hmm. there is a lot of talk about nudity
sure. have a good day

or there is [ITEM]

absolutely
A few that I loved recently were [ITEM] [ITEM] and [ITEM]
they are all relatively new so don't feel bad
you could also try some classics
like [ITEM]
or [ITEM]
do you have a favorite actor?
maybe I can recommend some of their dramas
oh he's great
have a great day
Im actually new as well
what kind of movies are you interested in?
Thus us a hard question for me, but I think [ITEM] is my top.
I love scifi too
which [ITEM] is your favorite?
She honestly is in incredible through the whole thing
what are your thpughts on [ITEM]
or [ITEM]
the prequels are slightly less painful if you watch in machete order I think
so you do [ITEM] then [ITEM] , [ITEM] [ITEM] and end with [ITEM]
it shifts the perspective in some fun ways
because 2 and three then become flashbacks in the original arc rather than their own messy stand alone thing
its also just a fun way to kill a weekend if you don't have other plans
I'm not sure if they have worked in the new films yet but theres lots of discussion if you just google [ITEM] and machete order
thanks bye
